  "abstract": ["The aim of the Natural Capital Accounts is to map out the relationship between nature, economy and human activities in a clear and internationally comparable way - literally. CBS is working with  Wageningen University on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) to develop models, data and maps that provide a spatial and as complete as possible picture of the current state of Natural Capital in the Netherlands. This system of accounts is based on ecosystem services; the contributions of ecosystems to our economy and to other human activities.\n\nThe project follows the guidelines of the SEEA EEA developed in the UN context and also contributes to its further development. The figure below shows that a large number of topics are addressed that are logically related to each other. The size of an ecosystem together with the quality of that ecosystem determines the quantity and nature of the ecosystem services provided: the physical supply and use tables. This physical supply of services is also valued monetarily and can ultimately be related to the national accounts . In addition, thematic datasets and maps have been developed that show the carbon balance and biodiversity. These are further explained under the various themes."],
