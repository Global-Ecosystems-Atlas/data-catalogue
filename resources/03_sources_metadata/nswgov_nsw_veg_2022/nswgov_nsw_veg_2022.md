## Abstract
The State Vegetation Type Map (SVTM) is a regional-scale map of NSW Plant Community Types. This map represents the current extent of each Plant Community Type, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation, across all tenures in NSW. This map is updated periodically as part of the Integrated BioNet Vegetation Data program to improve quality and alignment to the NSW vegetation classification hierarchy.

The map is supplied as ESRI Feature Class (Quickview) and 5m GeoTiff Raster, and can be viewed and analysed in most commercial and open-source spatial software packages. If you prefer to use the download package, we supply an ArcGIS v10.4 mxd and/or a layer file for suggested symbology. The raster attributes contain PCT, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation.
