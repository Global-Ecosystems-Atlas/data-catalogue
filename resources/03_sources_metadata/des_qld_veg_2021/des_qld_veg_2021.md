## Abstract
The State of Queensland in northeast Australia covers 1.73 million square kilometres and encompasses a wide variety of landscapes across temperate, wet and dry tropics and semiarid to arid climatic zones. Currently (April 2023), 1435 regional ecosystems are recognised across Queensland. Regional ecosystems are defined and mapped at 1:100,000 scale across the state. Many regional ecosystems include one or more vegetation communities, some of which are only recognised and mapped at scales larger than 1:100,000. A vegetation community is an association within a regional ecosystem that has similar structure and floristics and occurs within the same land zone. Broad Vegetation Groups (BVGs) are a higher-level grouping of vegetation communities and regional ecosystems. 

BVGs provide an overview of vegetation across the state or a bioregion. They are a useful addition to the regional ecosystem framework by providing an overview of major ecological patterns and relationships across Queensland, independent of bioregions and land zones, and facilitate comparisons with vegetation in other states and internationally. The primary aim of this document is to concisely describe the BVGs of Queensland to enhance their use in government planning, policy and regulation, e.g., vegetation offsets, Bushfire Hazard Area mapping, public education and scientific investigations. Floristic, structural, functional, biogeographic and landscape attributes have all been used in the BVG classification. The first aggregation of BVGs in the hierarchical classification is determined on the basis of vegetation structure (cover, height and growth form) of the ecologically dominant layer. BVGs are ordered broadly to reflect the vegetation structure along a mesic gradient from wet closed forests (rainforests) of the coast and north east, to the arid spinifex hummock grasslands of the south west.
