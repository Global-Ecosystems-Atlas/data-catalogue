## Abstract
This vegetation map shows the extant distributions of vegetation classes throughout NSW, and provides users with information about the resolution, currency and uncertainties in the underlying data that were used to assemble the map. Data represents NSW native vegetation extent, compiled from various vegetation maps using methods outlined in Simpson et al. (2011) and in Keith and Simpson (2010). 

The NSW vegetation map (version 2.2, Keith and Simpson 2006) was revised by interpreting additional candidate maps as vector layers and synthesising these into a single raster-based data set. This involved eight steps: developing a comprehensive 'standard' classification of vegetation classes for NSW; collating and standardising the projection and format of candidate source maps; assigning vegetation units of source maps to NSW vegetation classes; assessing the spatial resolution, currency and reliability of candidate source maps; assembling a composite map from candidate source maps to maximise reliability; applying a spatial mask to represent extant native vegetation; adjusting spatial resolution by dissolving small polygons and converting to 200 m raster; attributing the spatial resolution, currency and reliability of the underlying source data sets. 

The classification of 106 vegetation classes described by Keith (2004) was adopted as the framework for preparation of version 3.03 of the NSW vegetation map. Polygons from the "Estuarine macrophytes CCA" dataset of less than 0.1 ha were eliminated. For all other datasets polygons of less than 2 ha were eliminated. The map incorporates data from a statewide woody vegetation mask from the NSW Woody Vegetation Change Detection Program (Kitchen et al. 2010). 

The map is presented as a raster within an ESRI ArcGIS (9.3) geodatabase. Supersedes Keith and Simpson (2006), Keith (2004) and Pressey et al. (2000). Pressey et al. (2000) was the native veg extent product used to calculate native veg cover values for the Over-Cleared Landscapes Database prior to July 2006.
