## Abstract
This map of the terrestrial ecosystems of Myanmar was developed using a supervised learning approach to classify earth observation data and other geospatial datasets into broad mappable units, which was then split into the ecosystem types defined by the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems of Myanmar project.The raster presents the hierarchical ecosystem typology for Myanmar, including attributes that indicate ecosystems grouped at the Biome (11 classes), Functional Ecotype (21 classes) and Ecosystem Type (64 classes) level of the Myanmar ecosystem typology.
