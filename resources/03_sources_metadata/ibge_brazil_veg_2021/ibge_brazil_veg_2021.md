## Abstract
The Continuous Vegetation Base of Brazil, an integral part of the Environmental Database and Information (BDiA), is a product of the IBGE Natural Resources Mapping project which, in its constitution, also includes the Geology, Geomorphology and Pedology databases, adjusted to the Continuous Cartographic Base of Brazil at the scale 1:250,000 (BC250).

Vegetation mapping covers the land cover of the national territory, according to the Brazilian vegetation classification used by the IBGE. The information was produced in digital format, from 1997 to 2017, based on the compilation of existing data, interpretation of orbital images, field expeditions and bibliographic research. The vector product is made available with complementary tabular information on the classification. The methods used in the mapping are described in the IBGE's Technical Manual of Brazilian Vegetation.
