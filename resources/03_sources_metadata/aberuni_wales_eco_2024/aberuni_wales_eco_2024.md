## Abstract
This study introduces a hierarchical-modular framework based on the globally applicable Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) whereby the land cover classes can be systematically translated to habitat categories and further differentiated by referencing contextual information and expert knowledge. Application is showcased for Wales (United Kingdom) where 10 m spatial resolution land cover maps were first constructed nationally from time-series of Sentinel-1C-band radar and − 2 optical data (2018–2020). The contextual datasets derived from non-EO sources were utilised to associate dominant vegetation types to detailed habitat classes.
