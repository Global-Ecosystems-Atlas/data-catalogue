## Abstract
This dataset contains global maps of tidal flat ecosystems produced via a supervised classification of 707,528 Landsat Archive images. Each pixel was classified into tidal flat, permanent water or other with reference to a globally distributed set of training data. This product depicts tidal flat ecosystems around the global coastline. Pixels classified as tidal flat in the analysis represent several types of tidal flat ecosystems, including unconsolidated fine-grain sediments (tidal mudflats), unconsolidated coarse-grain sediments (tidal sand flats), and consolidated sediments, organic material or rocks (wide tidal rock-platforms), while excluding spectral signatures indicating the presence of vegetation dominated intertidal ecosystems such as mangroves and vegetated marshes. The analysis aimed to identify pixels that are subject to regular tidal inundation, and therefore may also include other intertidal systems where intertidal dynamics are observable.
