## Abstract
The Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla) developed a method called
multi-source national forest inventory (MS-NFI). The first operative results
were calculated in 1990. Small area forest resource estimates, in here
municipality level estimates, and estimates of variables in map form are
calculated using field data from the Finnish national forest inventory,
satellite images and other digital georeferenced data, such as topographic
database of the National Land Survey of Finland. Eleven sets of estimates have
been produced for the most part of the country until now and ten sets for
Lapland. The number of the map form themes in the most recent version, from
year 2021, is 45. In addition to the volumes by tree species and timber
assortments, the biomass by tree species groups and tree compartments have
been estimated.
