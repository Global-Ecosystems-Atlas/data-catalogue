  "abstract": ["The contemporary product was derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). The imagery, with a spatial resolution of 10 meters was pre-processed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) following established methods for retrieval of benthic signals. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used for classification. Training data encompassed three classes: seagrass, non-seagrass (including coral reefs, mangroves, sand/rubble, and macroalgal beds), and optical-deep water (ODW), totaling 25,463 training pixels. Important: the classification output is a binary (seagrass/non-seagrass) class. Validation of the map was conducted independently using 1,019 in-situ field survey points collected from 2017-2023. Mapping accuracy was assessed through an error matrix. Overall accuracy = 82%"],
