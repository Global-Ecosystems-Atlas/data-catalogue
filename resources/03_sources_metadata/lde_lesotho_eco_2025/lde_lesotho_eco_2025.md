## Abstract
This map is composed of several layers. The first map presents ecosystems at a level that is consistent with Levels 5 or 6 of the Global Ecosystem Typology (South African National Biodiversity Institute (2006- ). The Vegetation Map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, Mucina, L., Rutherford, M.C. and Powrie, L.W. (Editors), Online, https://bgis.sanbi.org/Projects/Detail/2258, Version 2024.). The South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) has cross referenced these ecosystems to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystems Typology. The result is a map of ecosystem functional groups at Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. 

The second layer contains spatial information on anthropogenic or human-modified terrestrial ecosystems, based on Lesotho’s national landcover atlas (FAO. (2023). Lesotho: Land cover atlas 2017–2021. Maseru). This information presents ten landcover classes identified using satellite remote sensing. The ten landcover classes were cross-referenced to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. Of note, tree- and shrub-covered landscapes identified from landcover are reassigned to the underlying ecosystem functional group (which, in the case of Lesotho, is Temperate subhumid grasslands). This is because even if these ecosystems are covered by woody vegetation, they retain the same predominant ecological drivers of grasslands (i.e. grazing, fires, frost, seasonal precipitation). Similarly, erosion gullies are considered as degraded versions of the underlying ecosystems, rather than a distinct ecosystem functional group. Bare surfaces identified from satellite tend to represent exposed sandstone within grassland ecosystems, rather than a distinct ecosystem functional group. Based on this, landcover information can be used to identify human-modified ecosystem functional groups

The third layer contains spatial information on the distribution of freshwater ecosystems. For the F2.3. Seasonal Freshwater Lakes, the national land cover data was used (FAO. (2023). Lesotho: Land cover atlas 2017–2021. Maseru.). For dams (Lehner, B., Beames, P., Mulligan, M. et al. (2024). The Global Dam Watch database of river barrier and reservoir information for large-scale applications. Sci Data 11, 1069), we distinguished between two ecosystem functional groups depending on the depth of the waterbody. Dams that were deeper than 15 m were classified as F3.1 Large Reservoirs. Dams shallower than 15m were classified as F3.2 Constructed Lacustrine Wetlands. For rivers (Resource Quality Services (was IWQS) and Chief Directorate of National GeoSpatial Information (was Surveys and Mapping) (2012) Rivers of South Africa. Department of Water Affair, Pretoria, South Africa), permanent or perennial rivers were classified as F1.1. Permanent upland streams. Non-perennial streams and streams with unknown flow status were classified as F1.2 Seasonal upland streams. Wetlands identified from landcover data were all classified as F2.3 Seasonal freshwater lakes. 

Spatial information on natural terrestrial ecosystems, human-modified ecosystems, and freshwater ecosystem can be combined in a compilation map of Eswatini’s ecosystems.
