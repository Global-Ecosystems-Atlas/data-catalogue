1,uf_arctic_veg_2022,Raster Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map Version 2,english,"The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM) shows the types of vegetation that occur across the Arctic—between the Arctic Ocean to the north and the northern limit of forests (“treeline”) to the south. Here, environmental and climatic conditions are extreme, with a short growing season and low summer temperatures.

The region supports plants such as dwarf shrubs, herbs, lichens and mosses, which grow close to the ground. As one moves southward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth increases , allowing the size, abundance, and variety of plants to increase. Other environmental controls, such as elevation, topography, soil chemistry, soil moisture, and the past history of plant colonization, also influence the distribution of plant communities. The colors on the map indicate the differences that occur in the outward appearance of vegetation.

An international team of Arctic vegetation scientists representing the six countries of the Arctic—Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and the United States—prepared the map. Methods, additional thematic maps, detailed descriptions of the 16 map units, and photos of representative plant communities and species are on the reverse side. Get a more detailed overview at About the CAVM.

The Raster Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (Raster CAVM) map groups over 400 described plant communities into 16 vegetation types, glaciers, saline water, and freshwater at 1-km resolution.

Macquarie Island (54 degrees S 159 degrees E) is a subantarctic island (c. 35km by 3 to 5km) approximately equidistant between Tasmania, New Zealand and Antarctica in the Southern Ocean. The vegetation is herbaceous, lacking shrubs and trees. Vegetation and drainage are mapped at a scale of 1:25 000 from field observations, satellite imagery and limited oblique and aerial photography. The categories adopted for mapping vegetation are based on attributes of foliage height and percentage foliage cover of the ground surface (vegetation structure), not on species distribution (floristics). The distribution of vegetation categories is strongly correlated with aspect, topography and rock type. Mires, streams and lakes form an intricate drainage pattern that is strongly influenced by the geology of this tectonically active emergent crest of the submarine Macquarie Ridge at the boundary of the Pacific and Australian plates.

Currently (April 2023), 1435 regional ecosystems are recognised across Queensland. Regional ecosystems are defined and mapped at 1:100,000 scale across the state. Many regional ecosystems include one or more vegetation communities, some of which are only recognised and mapped at scales larger than 1:100,000. A vegetation community is an association within a regional ecosystem that has similar structure and floristics and occurs within the same land zone. Broad Vegetation Groups (BVGs) are a higher-level grouping of vegetation communities and regional ecosystems. 

BVGs provide an overview of vegetation across the state or a bioregion. They are a useful addition to the regional ecosystem framework by providing an overview of major ecological patterns and relationships across Queensland, independent of bioregions and land zones, and facilitate comparisons with vegetation in other states and internationally. The primary aim of this document is to concisely describe the BVGs of Queensland to enhance their use in government planning, policy and regulation, e.g., vegetation offsets, Bushfire Hazard Area mapping, public education and scientific investigations. Floristic, structural, functional, biogeographic and landscape attributes have all been used in the BVG classification. The first aggregation of BVGs in the hierarchical classification is determined on the basis of vegetation structure (cover, height and growth form) of the ecologically dominant layer. BVGs are ordered broadly to reflect the vegetation structure along a mesic gradient from wet closed forests (rainforests) of the coast and north east, to the arid spinifex hummock grasslands of the south west.",Department of Environment and Science (Queensland),,TRUE,CC BY 4.0 DEED,"Department of Environment and Science (2021), Remnant 2021 broad vegetation groups - Queensland [dataset].

9,aca_global_reef_2022,Allen Coral Atlas,english,"The Allen Coral Atlas is built by a dedicated team of scientists, technologists, and conservationists, using one-of-a-kind methodologies. The Allen Coral Atlas was conceived and funded by the late Paul Allen’s Vulcan Inc. and is managed by the Arizona State University Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science. Along with partners from Planet, the Coral Reef Alliance, and the University of Queensland, the Atlas utilizes high-resolution satellite imagery and advanced analytics to map and monitor the world’s coral reefs in unprecedented detail. The partnership together identified the following methods for habitat map creation, dynamic monitoring, and other related coral reef products. 

As part of the Allen Coral Atlas’s revisions to its habitat maps in 2022, a new reef extent product was generated for each mapping region. In context of this product, reef extent is defined as the location of shallow coral reef features that can generally be seen from satellites. It typically excludes areas of very deep and very turbid water. This is intended to provide a more generalized and inclusive layer that depicts the extent of the coral reef environment which is additional to the Atlas’ geomorphic zonation maps. The reef extent data product can be seen as a single layer on the Atlas and compared and analyzed alongside other datasets such as reef habitat maps and reef threat monitoring datasets. 

The underlying reef extent product is a raster at 5m pixel resolution, matching the geomorphic and benthic map products. The raster combines three sources:

1. The extent of the Allen Coral Atlas’s 12 geomorphic zones

2. The extent of our own machine learning-based coral reef habitat layer, originally developed for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network’s 2020 Report on the Status of Coral Reefs of the World

3. A third extent layer that: Filled in holes greater than 400 pixels (0.64Ha) and applied a morphological filter (circle kernel of 5 pixels; 25m) to smooth the reef boundaries and regain missing slope/beach features..

For the purposes of the data product made visible on the Allen Coral Atlas, these three sources are combined into one single-colored layer.

The reef extent layer more inclusively depicts the shallow coral reef environment than our more detailed benthic or geomorphic habitat maps. It includes reef features that were unmappable to geomorphic/benthic level, including deeper reef structures, reef habitat in more turbid water, deep or very steep reef slope areas, and very shallow intertidal areas at the land-sea interface. Known limitations are that some areas of supra-tidal beach and vegetation are included, which may not strictly be coral reef environments. Overall, the reef extent product is still conservative, and we expect that the area of reef erroneously included at the land-sea interface is greatly outweighed by the areas of reef still missed at both the shallow and deep margins of the product.",Allen Coral Atlas Partnership; University of New South Wales; University of Queensland; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; Coral Reef Alliance; Arizona State University; National Geographic Society,,TRUE,CC BY 4.0,"Allen Coral Atlas (2022).

Recent advances in cloud-based geospatial platforms have enabled the development of an analysis pipeline to monitor saltmarsh distribution at a continental scale. Our remote sensing pipeline builds on work to develop the first integrated global maps of tidal flat, saltmarsh and mangrove ecosystems. 

We are first compiling a large set of occurrence records to train our remote sensing classification models (at least 10,000 point records across Australia's coastline). Our training set includes field data acquired from Australia's saltmarsh research community, published papers and records developed from high-resolution image interpretation conducted at JCU's Global Ecology Lab. 

Our remote sensing classification approach uses up to 100 nationwide remote sensing-derived covariate layers to support a suite of machine-learning classification models. The classification models are tasked with estimating the coastal ecosystem type of every 30-m pixel that occurs around Australia's coastal zone. This mapping framework will be implemented as a collaborative effort between JCU, UNSW and Digital Earth Australia.

The study used a map-to-image approach to change detection where the baseline map (GMW v2.5) was updated using thresholding and a contextual mangrove change mask. This approach was applied between all image-date pairs producing 10 maps for each epoch, which were summarised to produce the global mangrove time-series. The resulting mangrove extent maps had an estimated accuracy of 87.4 % (95th conf. int.: 86.2 - 88.6 %), although the accuracies of the individual gain and loss change classes were lower at 58.1 % (52.4 - 63.9 %) and 60.6 % (56.1 - 64.8 %), respectively. Sources of error included a mis-registration in the SAR mosaic datasets, which could only be partially corrected for, but also confusion in fragmented areas of mangroves, such as around aquaculture ponds.

To better understand the global distribution and changes in tidal marsh extent, and identify opportunities for their conservation and restoration, it is critical to develop a spatial knowledge base of their global occurrence. 

Here, we develop a globally consistent tidal marsh distribution map for the year 2020 at 10-m resolution. To map the location of the world’s tidal marshes we applied a random forest classification model to earth observation data from the year 2020. We trained the classification model with a reference dataset developed to support distribution mapping of coastal ecosystems, and predicted the spatial distribution of tidal marshes between 60°N to 60°S. We validated the tidal marsh map using standard accuracy assessment methods, with our final map having an overall accuracy score of 0.852. We estimate the global extent of tidal marshes in 2020 to be 52,880 km2 (95% CI: 32,030 to 59,780 km2) distributed across 120 countries and territories. Tidal marsh distribution is centred in temperate and Arctic regions, with nearly half of the global extent of tidal marshes occurring in the temperate Northern Atlantic (45%) region. At the national scale, over a third of the global extent (18,510 km2; CI: 11,200 – 20,900) occurs within the USA.

Data were compiled for 82 countries around the world, with most country maps originating from supervised classification or manual polygon delineation of Landsat, SPOT or RapidEye satellite imagery.

The category of “planted trees” in the SDPT includes forest plantations of native or introduced species, established through deliberate human planting or seeding. Sometimes called “tree farms,” these forests infuse the global economy with a constant stream of lumber for construction, pulp for paper and fuelwood for energy. The data set also includes agricultural tree crops like oil palm plantations, avocado farms, apple orchards and even Christmas tree farms. The SDPT makes it possible to identify planted forests and tree crops as being separate from natural forests and enables changes in these planted areas to be monitored independently from changes in global natural forest cover.

The SDPT contains 173 million hectares of planted forest and 50 million hectares of agricultural trees, or approximately 82% of the world’s total planted forest area in 2015 (FAO 2015). The SDPT was compiled through a procedure that included cleaning and processing each individual data set before creating a harmonized attribute table.

19,trworld_global_plant_2016,Layer: Tree plantations by type,english,"This data set was created by Transparent World, with the support of Global Forest Watch. Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.

Given the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily Landsat, supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.

Each polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A “gr” in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:* Large industrial plantation: single plantation units larger than 100 hectares* Mosaic of medium-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use* Mosaic of small-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.* Clearing/ very young plantation: bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc)For more information on this data set and how it was produced, see the forthcoming WRI Technical Note associated with this project.",Transparent World; Global Forest Watch,,TRUE,CC BY 4.0 DEED,"Transparent World (2016) Tree plantations [dataset], Accessed through Global Forest Watch on [28/03/2024]. www.globalforestwatch.org",Regional,NA,https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/gfw::tree-plantations/explore

Ice transforms the hydrologic, ecologic, climatic and socio-economic functions of river corridors. Although river ice extent has been shown to be declining in many regions of the world, the seasonality, historical change and predicted future changes in river ice extent and duration have not yet been quantified globally. Previous studies of river ice, which suggested that declines in extent and duration could be attributed to warming temperatures were based on data from sparse locations. Furthermore, existing projections of future ice extent are based solely on the location of the 0-°C isotherm. Here, using satellite observations, we show that the global extent of river ice is declining, and we project a mean decrease in seasonal ice duration of 6.10 ± 0.08 days per 1-°C increase in global mean surface air temperature. We tracked the extent of river ice using over 400,000 clear-sky Landsat images spanning 1984–2018 and observed a mean decline of 2.5 percentage points globally in the past three decades. To project future changes in river ice extent, we developed an observationally calibrated and validated model, based on temperature and season, which reduced the mean bias by 87 per cent compared with the 0-degree-Celsius isotherm approach. We applied this model to future climate projections for 2080–2100: compared with 2009–2029, the average river ice duration declines by 16.7 days under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, whereas under RCP 4.5 it declines on average by 7.3 days.

The main objective is presentation of the information on forest resources of the country at state and district level and to prepare forest cover maps on 1:50,000 scale. First assessment of forest cover of the country was made in 1987 and thereafter eight more assessments have been made. District wise information on forest cover has been made available from the third assessment (i.e. from 1991) onwards.

Till the fourth assessment interpretation of data for the entire country had been done visually. During fifth and sixth assessment interpretation of data for Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra which comprises 28% forest cover of the country had been done digitally and for rest of the States/UTs, it had been done visually. In seventh assessment interpretation has been done digitally for thirteen states namely; Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Delhi (UT), Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, which comprises 63% of the forest cover of the country. By eighth assessment the entire country was covered by digital assessment.

The forest cover is broadly classified in 4 classes, namely very dense forest, moderately dense forest, open forest and mangrove. The classification of the cover into dense and open forests is based on internationally adopted norms of classification. It has not been possible to further segregate the dense forest into more classes owing to enormity of work of ground validation and limitations of methodology. Mangroves have been separately classified because of their characteristic tone and texture and unique ecological functions.","Ministry of Environment, Forest & Clilmate Change",,TRUE,Unknown,"Ministry of Environment, Forest & Clilmate Change (2019), Forest Cover Mapping, Forest Survey of India, version 16.",India,NA,https://fsi.nic.in/introduction

The LULC maps are generated using multi-temporal satellite data of IRS AWiFS sensor for year 2017-18.

The data was classified following a hybrid approach (Decision Tree - See5 or Supervised MXL or both). The selection of a classifier is dependent on the number of temporal datasets available during the season, freedom from cloud/haze, complexity of the terrain and temporal registration errors etc., The classification procedure followed is as per the guidelines given in LULC manual. In North Eastern states, Jammu & Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka the required temporal registration was found to be a limiting factor due to complexity of the terrain. In these states the cropped areas were extracted using the individual months and combined with the other LULC information.

The accuracy was assessed at state level (India administrative unit).Stratified random points generated were used to assess the accuracy of classification. The number of sample points for each strata for selected based on the proportion of the area. However, a minimum of 20 sample points were considered for each class to estimate the accuracy of the classified output.

63,conabio_mex_lcov_2015,A proper Land Cover and Forest Type Classification Scheme for Mexico,english,"The imminent implementation of a REDD+ MRV system in Mexico in 2015, demanding operational annual land cover change reporting, requires highly accurate, annual and high resolution forest type maps; not only for monitoring but also to establish the historical baseline from the 1990s onwards. The employment of any supervised classifier demands exhaustive definition of land cover classes and the representation of all classes in the training stage. This paper reports the process of a data driven class separability analysis and the definition and application of a national land cover classification scheme. All Landsat data recorded over Mexico in the year 2000 with cloud coverage below 10 percent and a national digital elevation model have been used. Automatic wall-2-wall image classification has been performed trained by national reference data on land use and vegetation types with 66 classes. Validation has been performed against field plots of the national forest inventory. Groups of non-separable classes have subsequently been discerned by automatic iterative class aggregation. Class aggregations have finally been manually revised and modified towards a proposed national land cover classification scheme at 4 levels with 35 classes at the highest level including 13 classes for primary temperate and tropical forests, 2 classes for secondary temperate and tropical forest, 1 for induced or cultivated forest, as also 8 different scrubland classes. The remaining 11 classes cover agriculture, grassland, wetland, water bodies, urban and other vegetation land cover classes. The remaining 3 levels provide further hierarchic aggregations with 14, 10, and 8 classes, respectively. Trained by the relabeled training dataset wall-2-wall classification towards the 35 classes has been performed. The final national land cover dataset has been validated against more than 200,000 polygons randomly distributed all over the country with class labels derived by manual interpretation. The agreement for all 35 classes at level 4 was 71%. Primary forest classes have been identified with accuracies between 60% and 83%. Secondary forest classes rated only 50% finding major confusion with the primary forest classes. Accuracies over the scrubland classes have been calculated between 60% and 90%. Agreements for aggregated temperate and tropical forest classes was 85% and 80%, respectively.

This file is the map of land cover and forest formations for about the year 2000 for Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra. These data are the original basis for the 2001 NLCD data from the USGS.

Important notes: 
1. Open drought deciduous woodlands, with 25 to 60% woody vegetation cover, are grouped with pasture in the version of this map that is generalized to land cover. 
2. Low density urban lands are included with the Urban class and may have as little as 10-15% urban/built-up lands. 
3. Errors from minor misregristration between the maps from 1991-2000 will cause some error in analyses of change. 
4. We recommend using urban change data from Helmer and Ruefenacht (2005) to estimate urban change from 1991-2000. 

On the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, forest, urban/built-up and pasture lands have replaced most formerly cultivated lands. The extent and age distribution of each forest type that undergoes land development, however, is unknown. This study assembles a time series of four land-cover maps for Puerto Rico. The time series includes two digitized paper maps of land cover in 1951 and 1978 that are based on photo interpretation. The other two maps are of forest type and land cover and are based on decision tree classification of Landsat image mosaics dated 1991 and 2000. With the map time series we quantify land-cover changes from 1951 to 2000; map forest age classes in 1991 and 2000; and quantify the forest that undergoes land development (urban development or surface mining) from 1991 to 2000 by forest type and age. This step relies on intersecting a map of land development from 1991-2000 (from the same satellite imagery) with the forest age and type maps. Land-cover changes from 1991-2000 that continue prior trends include urban expansion and transition of sugar cane, pineapple and other lowland agriculture to pasture. Forest recovery continues, but it has slowed. Emergent and forested wetland area increased between 1977 and 2000. Sun coffee cultivation appears to have increased slightly. Most of the forests cleared for land development, 55 percent, were young (1-13 yr). Only 13 percent of the developed forest was older (41-55+ yr).

The United States and British Virgin Islands are composed of six major islands and over 40 small islands and cays. Located in the Caribbean's Leeward Island chain, the region is situated between the Caribbean Sea to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the north. The major islands in the U.S. territory include St Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John in the southern region, while the dominant islands in the British territory include Tortola, Virgin Gorda and Anegada to the north. The center of the island region (18 20'N, 64 40'W) is approximately 30 km east of Puerto Rico and has a combined area of approximately 50,000 ha consisting of subdued to rugged topography with elevation ranging from just below sea level in some wetlands and mangrove swamps to over 500 m on Tortola.

This particular dataset (IITF_JRS02_usbvi_landcov2.img) is generalized from the original data to have a classification scheme for forest formations that is consistent with that of the maps developed for Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, St Kitts, Nevis, St. Eustatius, Barbados and Grenada (Helmer et al. 2008, Carib. J. Sci. Vol 44). The more detailed scheme is available in the file IITF_JRS2_usbvi_landcov1.img.

Woody vegetation formations on the islands are subtropical and include drought deciduous xeric coastal forest and shrub with succulents, evergreen coastal shrubland, deciduous, evergreen and mixed forest and shrubland with succulents, semi-deciduous, and seasonal evergreen forests. Pasture and young leguminous secondary forest and forest shrub formations are present at lower elevations where natural and human caused disturbance including sheep and grazing has occurred.

Multi-part Landsat ETM+ scenes centered around the year 2000 that had been processed for cloud and cloud shadow elimination were classified using decision tree classification software. The classification techniques use decision tree software to classify 15m panchromatic sharpened Landsat satellite image bands and ancillary geospatial data.

91,usyd_global_seafloor_2015,Census of seafloor sediments in the world’s ocean,english,"Knowing the patterns of distribution of sediments in the global ocean is critical for understanding biogeochemical cycles and how deep-sea deposits respond to environmental change at the sea surface. We present the first digital map of seafloor lithologies based on descriptions of nearly 14,500 samples from original cruise reports, interpolated using a support vector machine algorithm. We show that sediment distribution is more complex, with significant deviations from earlier hand-drawn maps, and that major lithologies occur in drastically different proportions globally. By coupling our digital map to oceanographic data sets, we find that the global occurrence of biogenic oozes is strongly linked to specific ranges in sea-surface parameters. In particular, by using recent computations of diatom distributions from pigment-calibrated chlorophyll-a satellite data, we show that, contrary to a widely held view, diatom oozes are not a reliable proxy for surface productivity. Their global accumulation is instead strongly dependent on low surface temperature (0.9–5.7 °C) and salinity (33.8–34.0 PSS, Practical Salinity Scale 1978) and high concentrations of nutrients. Under these conditions, diatom oozes will accumulate on the seafloor regardless of surface productivity as long as there is limited competition from biogenous and detrital components, and diatom frustules are not significantly dissolved prior to preservation. Quantifying the link between the seafloor and the sea surface through the use of large digital data sets will ultimately lead to more robust reconstructions and predictions of climate change and its impact on the ocean environment.",University of Sydney; National ICT Australia (NICTA),,FALSE,Unknown,"Adriana Dutkiewicz, R.

The detailed mapping of vegetation types, called physiognomies, is still a challenge due to their high spectral similarity and spatial variability. There are three major ecosystem groups (forest, savanna, and grassland), which can be hierarchically subdivided into 25 detailed physiognomies, according to a well-known classification system. We used an adapted U-net architecture to process a WorldView-2 image with 2-m spatial resolution to hierarchically classify the physiognomies of a Cerrado protected area based on deep learning techniques. Several spectral channels were tested as input datasets to classify the three major ecosystem groups (first level of classification). The dataset composed of RGB bands plus 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) achieved the best performance and was used to perform the hierarchical classification. In the first level of classification, the overall accuracy was 92.8%. On the other hand, for the savanna and grassland detailed physiognomies (second level of classification), 86.1% and 85.0% were reached, respectively.

94,embrapa_cerrado_ecoreg_2019,Cerrado ecoregions: A spatial framework to assess and prioritize Brazilian savanna environmental diversity for conservation,portuguese; english,"The Brazilian Cerrado is the second largest biome in Latin America, extending over more than 200 million ha and hosts some of the most intensive agricultural activities for grain and beef production in the world. Because of the biodiversity richness and high levels of endemism, Cerrado is considered one of world's hotspot for biodiversity conservation. The objectives of this study are three-fold: to present a comprehensive division of Cerrado into different ecoregions that reflect the environmental heterogeneity within the biome; to analyze the ecoregions in terms of biophysical characteristics, protected areas, environmental liability in riparian permanent protection areas along watercourses, and priorities for biodiversity conservation; and to rank the ecoregions in terms of endangerment for biodiversity conservation and restoration. A previous study that delineated 22 ecoregions using geomorphology, vegetation, soil, geology, and plant diversity maps was revised using topography, vegetation, precipitation, and soil maps. Our new ecoregion map consists of 19 units that are unique in terms of landscape characteristics and has been adjusted to the current official boundary map of Cerrado. Some of the ecoregions consist of only one geomorphological compartment, whereas others are heterogeneous, consisting of up to eight compartments. Ferralsols comprise the dominant soil type in 14 of the ecoregions. The percentage of protected areas within ecoregions ranges from 1.7% to 51.5%. The most endangered ecoregion, where land use change critically threatens habitat integrity, is the Depressão Cárstica do São Francisco (states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Piauí), where environmental liability along riparian permanent protection areas amounts to 85.6% of the total area. Our proposed ecoregion map provides a spatial framework for regional and local assessments to improve decision-making processes to reconcile conservation and restoration planning, sustainable agriculture, and provision of ecosystem services. Besides de adjustment of the previous Cerrado's ecoregion map to the official biome boundary (relevant for the implementation of public policies of conservation as those regulated by the Brazilian Forest Code), the new analyses of the ecoregion map represent a substantial improvement in comparison to the ones conducted by the previous study in 2003. In addition, current web resources allow us to make all the information used or derived from this study available to other users.

The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.

TCFs are threatened by direct human pressures and climate change, yet the fate of these extraordinary ecosystems remains insufficiently quantified. With discussions of the post-2020 biodiversity framework underway, TCFs are a defining test case of the success and promise of recent policy targets and their associated mechanisms to avert the global biodiversity crisis. Here we present a global assessment of the recent status and trends of TCFs and their biodiversity and evaluate the efficacy of current protection measures. We find that cloud forests occupied 0.4% of the global land surface in 2001 and harboured ~3,700 species of birds, mammal, amphibians and tree ferns (~15% of the global diversity of those groups), with half of those species entirely restricted to cloud forests. Worldwide, ~2.4% of cloud forests (in some regions, more than 8%) were lost between 2001 and 2018, especially in readily accessible places. While protected areas have slowed this decline, a large proportion of loss in TCF cover is still occurring despite formal protection.

NatureServe ecologists lead efforts to develop internationally standardized classifications for terrestrial ecosystems and vegetation. One classification approach is with existing vegetation. The International Vegetation Classification, or EcoVeg approach (Faber-Langendoen et al. in press), grew out of USA federal standards, defining vegetation concepts at multiple thematic levels. Vegetation systems are defined as “moderate sets of diagnostic plant species and diagnostic growth forms that reflect biogeographic differences in composition and sub-continental to regional differences in mesoclimate, geology, substrates, hydrology, and disturbance regimes.” Building from prior national and regional ecological classifications from the area (see Josse et al. 2003; 2007), a hierarchical classification was established for existing vegetation types describing natural upland and wetland conditions. National and regional maps of current extent were reconciled to the standard classification and provided georeferenced locations for use in spatial modeling. Spatial modeling used climate, geophysical data layers, and satellite spectral data, in a sequential process to map potential distributions at several levels of the vegetation classification hierarchy. Inductive modeling in sequential steps, followed by expert review and refinement, resulted in a map of 147 vegetation macrogroups for the North American continent & the Caribbean. This map depicts the location and extent of each macrogroup had there been no intensive human land uses in recent centuries. Initial validation of the map, using a separate, randomized set of labeled sample areas of 0.5km2vs. 1km2vs. 5km2 indicated high agreement at finest spatial resolutions, suggesting that the map is suitable for use in applications requiring a pixel resolution of 270 x 270m2and higher.",NatureServe,,TRUE,Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License,"Comer, P.

Global-scale analyses suggest that human activities drive estuarine area change but these projections neglect direct human-estuary interactions and socio-economic feedbacks. Here, we quantified area changes of 2,396 estuaries in response to recent human impacts (e.g., land reclamation, estuarine dam construction) and economic development between 1984 and 2019, and find that estuarine area shrank by 5,372 km2 whereas upland submergence created 5,015 km2 of estuarine area elsewhere. Approximately 44% (n = 1,046) of today's estuaries have been directly altered through land reclamation, estuarine dam construction, or a combination of both, and ∼250,000 acres (1,027 km2) of estuarine area have been directly converted to urban or agricultural fields. Nearly 90% (923 km2) of land reclamation occurred in Asia linked to recent advances in economic development during the middle-income stage. Additional historical mapping and 5-year interval analyses revealed that while human alterations were insignificant during the low-income stages, estuaries were predominantly altered during their middle-income stages, where estuarine degradation is a common consequence of economic growth. However, this trend stabilizes in high-income countries with the adaption of conservation laws and policies.

131,geobon_global_ecodis_nd,Global Ecosystem Data Cube,english,"The distributions of different ecosystems, from lowland rainforests to alpine wetlands, are a key component of global biodiversity. Accordingly, comprehensive and detailed information on ecosystem distributions in space and their changes through time is urgently needed to support the monitoring framework of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as many other vital applications in science, policy, and management. To address this need, we here present a suite of national indicators of ecosystem-specific annual areas and areal changes. These indicators are based on the GlobES (Global EcoSystems) data cube, which maps the per-pixel areas of >70 terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and oceanic ecosystems annually since 1992 at a high spatial resolution. GlobES builds on recent progress in multi-decadal environmental mapping, integrating state-of-the-art information on land cover and land use, climate, geomorphology, hydrology, and various other environmental factors. For immediate applicability in conservation practice, the ecosystem types correspond to the habitat class scheme of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Extensive validation of the GlobES data cube against millions of ecosystem and species records has shown high overall accuracies (F1-score of 88%) that, however, vary across different regions and ecosystem types. To allow users to factor that uncertainty into their evaluations of ecosystem status and trends, the presented national ecosystem indicators will soon be associated with uncertainty bars, calculated by aggregating the spatiotemporally detailed uncertainty estimates determined for the GlobES ecosystem maps. As the number of available validation records will continue to increase rapidly, the detail and reliability of the GlobES data and of the associated uncertainties will further improve over the coming years. To allow these improvements to also enhance the precision and reliability of ecosystem monitoring, the national ecosystem indicators and their uncertainty bars will be periodically updated.

The GlobES ecosystem data cube currently undergoes final updates, before the final, fully documented datasets will be published as an open-access resource. To already facilitate discussions and planning, preliminary time series of the GlobES-based national ecosystem indicators are currently made available for exploration and download via this website. However, please note that until the finalization of the GlobES data is announced here, the provided indicator information should be considered preliminary and is not yet fit-for-purpose for official applications in science or policy.",GEOBON; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Reserach (iDiv); Federal Ministry of Education and Research ; Volkswagen Stiftung,,FALSE,Unknown,"Ruben Remelgado, Leonie Röhler, and Carsten Meyer. “Global Annual Distribution Data for Terrestrial, Freshwater, Coastal, and Oceanic Ecosystems” (in major revision)",Global,NA,https://globesdata.org/

We produced this novel habitat map by creating a global decision tree that intersects the best currently available global data on land cover, climate and land use. The maps broaden our understanding of habitats globally, assist in constructing area of habitat (AOH) refinements and are relevant for broad-scale ecological studies and future IUCN Red List assessments. We hope that these data and outlined framework will spur further development of biodiversity-relevant habitat maps at global scales. An interactive interface helping to navigate the map can be found at on the Naturemap website ( https://explorer.naturemap.earth/map).

Provided is the code to recreate the map (to made available soon), the global composite image at native -100m Copernicus resolution for level 1 and level 2 and layers of aggregated fractional cover (unit: [0-1] * 1000) at 1km for level 1 and level 2.

Starting with version 004 there changemasks for the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are supplied. Changemasks for the composite masks show the changed grid cells and their new values with earlier years being nested in later years, e.g. using the changemask for 2019 includes all changes up to 2019. For the fractional cover estimates at ~1km resolution, new fractional cover changemasks are supplied as subtraction (before - after) between the previous and current year (unit range: [-1 to 1] * 1000).

We highlight that only changes in land cover are considered since most of the ancillary layers (e.g. pasture, forest management, climate, etc...) are static and thus not all changes in habitats can be found.

Several habitat manuals were used to create a satellite classification system in order to produce a total of 54 different natural and man-made mapping categories at a very fine level of detail, with 41 terrestrial and 13 marine habitat categories. Land Use and Land Cover mapping was also derived from the imagery. Examples of the groundbreaking habitat maps are shown within this book, highlighting areas of critical ecological importance. 

In addition to continuous coverage of the entire Abu Dhabi land mass, satellites have been used to map marine areas to water depths of 15 metres.

Such information can be combined with other important Environment Agency- Abu Dhabi data sets to assist in conservation and preservation activities of endangered species. 

Using change detection techniques it is now possible to update the baseline mapping in rapid time. The loss or gain of critical habitats can be better detected, which in turn can help decision makers to understand how effective environmental policy measures have been.

The rapid spatial biodiversity assessment that reveals where the biodiversity of the country is found, what state it is in and how it could be prioritised. 

The Mapping Biodiversity Priorities (SANBI and UNEP-WCMC, 2016) approach is a systematic conservation planning approach based on 3 principles:

- The principle of representation is about ensuring that a sample of every species and every ecosystem type is protected or managed for conservation in some way. This avoids the common historical bias towards conserving certain charismatic species, or towards placing protected areas in places where there happen to be few competing land uses, so that only certain species and ecosystem types end up being protected. 
- The principle of persistence is to conserve the key ecological processes that are essential for ensuring that ecosystems and species can persist over time. This can include, for example, keeping ecological corridors intact that allow for species movement and connectivity in the landscape. 
- The third principle is to set quantitative biodiversity targets that guide how much biodiversity should be conserved. These targets underpin both the assessment and the prioritisation process. They can also be used to evaluate the success or impact of conservation actions.

The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) under the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism and with the technical guidance of the University of Botswana, the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) as well as the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) used this approach to develop maps of ecosystem types, ecological condition, ecosystem threat status and ecosystem protection level. These maps support the development of National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) and help prioritise implementation (NBSAP, 2015). They can also feed into national planning, policies and sectoral frameworks to ensure that development does not erode a nation’s natural capital. Phase One of the Mapping Biodiversity Priorities (MBP) project (2017 –2019) laid the foundation for mainstreaming of spatial biodiversity information into government decision making processes in Botswana. Integrated baseline layers were generated and used to conduct spatial biodiversity assessments of ecosystem threat status and protection level. Stakeholder meetings were convened to validate the products and entry points for mainstreaming the assessment products were identified. Phase Two (2020-2021) of the Mapping Biodiversity Priorities project is focused on integrating SBA products into the State of the Environment Report.",Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA); UN Environment Programme; WCMC; University of Botswana,,FALSE,Unknown,TBC,Botswana,NA,https://www.cbd.int/jbf/activities/nbsap1/pilotprojects/mbp

Moreover, the socio-economic data of stakeholders mapping and mainstreaming entry points were identified.

This Project offered unique opportunity to conduct spatial biodiversity assessments and to engage with a range of stakeholders that support development of evidence based Spatial Biodiversity Assessment (SBA) that enables exploration of sectoral synergies, trade-offs and policy impacts which in turn will improve the country’s technical capacity to curate, analyse and present spatial information, and capability to use it to integrate biodiversity issues into other sectors and national development processes such as transformative National Biodiversity and Strategy and Action Planning (NBSAP), and implementation. The Project also demonstrated the value of spatial data collection, curation and analysis to produce information products that can inform policy processes.

South African Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) and Dr. Stephen Holness (a technical lead from Nelson Mandela University) were partners of the Project that provided critical technical support, and Japan Biodiversity Fund (JBF) was the source fund through Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD). First and Second Stakeholder Workshops were conducted with kind financial support from Mainstreaming Incentives for Biodiversity Conservation Project which is housed in Environment, Forest and Climate Change Commission.

National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment (NSBA) was the first comprehensive national spatial assessment of the state of biodiversity, covering terrestrial, aquatic and wetland environments. It introduced two new headline indicators for assessing the state of Ethiopia’s biodiversity, namely: ecosystem threat status (referred to as ecosystem status), and ecosystem protection level. Ecosystem threat status informs how threatened the ecosystems or habitat types are, and ecosystem protection level indicates how well- or under-protected the ecosystems or habitat types are. These indicators are primary indicators that provide an overview of ecosystem state and will require further refinement in the future. Furthermore, the MBP approach creates opportunity to the country to develop the web-based online geo-portal platform to upload the NSBA products and supports the mechanisms for monitoring and reviewing implementation of the NBSAP.",Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute; Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority; UNEP; WCMC; SANBI; Japan Biodiversity Fund; Convention on Biological Diversity,,FALSE,Unknown,TBC,Ethiopia,NA,https://www.cbd.int/jbf/activities/nbsap1/pilotprojects/mbp

Here we map tropical dry forest height (RMSE=0.9 m, R2=0.84, range 0.6–7 m), and we map foliage height profiles, with a time series of Landsat and Advanced Land Imager (ALI) imagery on the island of Eleuthera, The Bahamas, substituting time for vertical canopy space. We also simultaneously map forest disturbance type and age. We map these variables in the context of avian habitat studies, particularly for wintering habitat of an endangered Nearctic-Neotropical migrant bird, the Kirtland's Warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii). We also illustrate relationships between forest vertical structure, disturbance type and counts of forage species important to the Kirtland's Warbler. The ALI imagery and the Landsat time series are both critical to the result for forest height, which the strong relationship of forest height with disturbance type and age facilitates. Also unique to this study is that seven of the eight image time steps are cloud-cleared images: mosaics of the clear parts of several cloudy scenes. We created each cloud-cleared image, including a virtually seamless ALI image mosaic, with regression tree normalization. We also illustrate how viewing time series imagery as red–green–blue composites of tasseled cap wetness (RGB wetness composites) aids reference data collection for classifying tropical forest disturbance type and age.

However, so far the potential of S1 has not been explored at such a scale. Capitalizing on the unique LUCAS 2018 Copernicus in-situ survey, we present the first continental crop type map at 10-m spatial resolution for the EU based on S1A and S1B Synthetic Aperture Radar observations for the year 2018. Random Forest classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We assess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling >3 M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The overall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop classes and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest accuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced accuracies higher than 96%. The correlation between the remotely sensed estimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99 (rape and turnip rape).

Accurate and timely information related to global irrigation is therefore needed to manage increasingly scarce water resources and to improve food security in the face of yield gaps, climate change and extreme events such as droughts, floods, and heat waves. Unfortunately, this information is not available for many regions of the world. This study aims to improve characterization of global rain-fed, irrigated and paddy croplands by integrating information from national and sub-national surveys, remote sensing, and gridded climate data sets. To achieve this goal, we used supervised classification of remote sensing, climate, and agricultural inventory data to generate a global map of irrigated, rain-fed, and paddy croplands. We estimate that 314 million hectares (Mha) worldwide were irrigated circa 2005. This includes 66 Mha of irrigated paddy cropland and 249 Mha of irrigated non-paddy cropland. Additionally, we estimate that 1047 Mha of cropland are managed under rain-fed conditions, including 63 Mha of rain-fed paddy cropland and 985 Mha of rain-fed non-paddy cropland. More generally, our results show that global mapping of irrigated, rain-fed, and paddy croplands is possible by combining information from multiple data sources.

The objective of this technical note is to update the previously published SDPT in three areas: boundaries, to spatially differentiate planted trees on a global scale; tree species information, to help screen for the illegal exportation of timber products; and carbon sequestration rates, or removal factors, to improve maps of atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration by planted trees.

Key Findings:
Based on data compiled in SDPT version 2.0 (v2.0), in 2020 there were approximately 264 million hectares of planted forests worldwide, or 6.5 percent of total tree cover. An additional 65 million hectares were mapped as tree crops.
SDPT v2.0 planted forest area represents 90 percent of the world’s total planted forest area in 2020, as reported by FAO (2020).

However, differences in definitions and methods have led to spatial and typological inconsistencies among individual data sources, confounding their complementary use and integration. The Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD), published in 2004, with its globally seamless gridded depiction of major vegetated and non-vegetated wetland classes, has emerged over the last decades as a foundational reference map that has advanced research and conservation planning addressing freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem services, greenhouse gas emissions, land surface processes, hydrology, and human health. Here, we present a new iteration of this map, termed GLWD version 2, generated by harmonizing the latest ground- and satellite-based data products into one single database. Following the same design principle as its predecessor, GLWD v2 aims to avoid double-counting of overlapping surface water features while differentiating between natural and non-natural lakes, rivers of multiple sizes, and several other wetland types. The classification of GLWD v2 incorporates information on seasonality (i.e., permanent vs. intermittent vs. ephemeral); inundation vs. saturation (i.e., flooding vs. waterlogged soils); vegetation cover (e.g., forested swamps vs. non-forested marshes); salinity (e.g., salt pans); natural vs. non-natural origins (e.g., rice paddies); and a stratification of landscape position and water source (e.g., riverine, lacustrine, palustrine, coastal/marine). GLWD v2 represents 33 wetland classes and—including all intermittent classes—depicts a maximum of 18.2 million km2 of wetlands (13.4 % of the global land area excluding Antarctica). The spatial extent of each class is provided as the fractional coverage within each grid cell at a resolution of 15 arc-seconds (approximately 500 m at the equator), with cell fractions derived from input data at resolutions as small as 10 m. The updated GLWD v2 offers an improved representation of inland surface water extents and their classification for contemporary conditions. Despite being a static map, it includes classes that denote intrinsic temporal dynamics. GLWD v2 is designed to facilitate large-scale hydrological, ecological, biogeochemical, and conservation applications, aiming to support the study and protection of wetland ecosystems around the world.","McGill University; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; KU Leuven; LERMA, CNRS; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univerdity; Université Paris-Saclay; CSIRO Environment; Nick Davidson Environmental; Charle Sturt University; UNSW; Stockholm University; Wetlands Institute; Stanford University; Cornell University; University of Alberta; University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Joint Reserach Cenre (JRC); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Kansas State University; University of Cambridge; The University of Tokyo; World Wildlife Fund",,TRUE,CC BY 4.0,"Lehner, B., Anand, M., Fluet-Chouinard, E., Tan, F., Aires, F., Allen, G.

Although considered sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic pressures, the spatial extent of peatlands is poorly constrained. We report the development of an improved global peatland map, PEATMAP, based on a meta-analysis of geospatial information collated from a variety of sources at global, regional and national levels. We estimate total global peatland area to be 4.23 million km2, approximately 2.84% of the world land area. Our results suggest that previous global peatland inventories are likely to underestimate peat extent in the tropics, and to overestimate it in parts of mid- and high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Global wetland and soil datasets are poorly suited to estimating peatland distribution. For instance, tropical peatland extents are overestimated by Global Lakes and Wetlands Database – Level 3 (GLWD-3) due to the lack of ground-truthing data; and underestimated by the use of histosols to represent peatlands in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) v1.2, as large areas of swamp forest peat in the humid tropics are omitted. PEATMAP and its underlying data are freely available as a potentially useful tool for scientists and policy makers with interests in peatlands or wetlands.

The classification was developed in two phases. The first phase extended from Corpus Christi, Texas to the Sabine River, Louisiana and the second phase extended from the Sabine River, Louisiana to the the Perdido River, Alabama. An alternative classification containing only three marsh types was created for coastal Texas, in which, intermediate and brackish marsh were combined into a single class.

197,noaa_gom_seagrass_2011,Gulf of Mexico Data Atlas - Submerged Aquatic Vegetation - Gulf-wide,english,"Seagrass ecosystems are among the most productive and valuable benthic habitats found in the in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico region. They support a diverse array of ecological and habitat functions, as well as various human activities along the Gulf Coast. Maintaining and improving the health of seagrass ecosystems and all coastal and marine ecosystems are essential for ensuring the ecological and economic health of the Gulf of Mexico region. Seagrass habitats provide nursery areas for extensive recreationally and commercially significant marine life by providing spawning and foraging habitat for many species of finfish, shellfish, and crustaceans. Smaller species and juveniles find protection from predation in seagrass canopy cover. Seagrasses provide food and feeding habitat for wintering waterfowl and other water birds. Seagrasses also support many threatened and endangered species, such as sea turtles, manatees, and bottlenose dolphins, which eat seagrass leaves and/or feed on smaller animals found in seagrass habitats. Epiphytes and benthic organisms attach to and colonize seagrasses, providing food for many marine animals. The extensive plant biomass of seagrass beds feeds bacteria and microscopic animals at the base of a complex food web. Seagrass roots and rhizomes form an intricately interwoven, underground mat that stabilizes the shallow bottom sediment on the seafloor, while simultaneously contributing to water clarity and decreasing wave energy by trapping sediment through waves and currents in their leaves. Trapping sediment cleanses the water from fine particles, and uptake of dissolved nutrients by seagrass will reduce the overgrowth of algae as well, thereby significantly improving water quality. Changes in seagrass habitat distribution can indicate decreased water quality and poor overall health of coastal waters. Loss of seagrass habitats can lead not only to decreased water quality, but also to increased water column turbidity, shoreline erosion, and the loss of the varied habitat functions that seagrass ecosystems provide. The many valuable functions provided by seagrass habitats support the ecosystem and contribute to economic activities. Commercial and recreational fisheries and tourism are several of the top industries in the Gulf region. These activities bring hundreds of millions of dollars into local communities and are directly influenced by the health and productivity of such marine ecosystems as seagrass habitats.",Texas Parks and Wildlife Department; NOAA/NESDIS/NODC/NCDDC-National Coastal Data Development Center; U.S. Geological Survey; National Centers for Environmental Information,,TRUE,Unknown,Handley L.

We present a novel approach to develop an ecosystem extent account from existing ecosystem classifications. This study shows the spatial and statistical extent account of 26 ecosystems (i.e. forests, grasslands, croplands, and urban, among others) between 1970 and 2015 at the national scale. Extent accounts were developed at a resolution of 25 m and provided reliable information on how ecosystem types have changed over time in Spain. Our results reflect three main patterns in the extension account: (i) an increase in forest ecosystems, (ii) a considerable decrease in agroecosystems (especially annual croplands), and (iii) substantial development of urban areas. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first attempt to develop a robust methodology to measure the extent of ecosystems at the national level. The proposed approach is crucial for a strong knowledge of ecosystem dynamics and their implications for ecosystem conditions and services at a national level.

Data represents NSW native vegetation extent, compiled from various vegetation maps using methods outlined in Simpson et al. (2011) and in Keith and Simpson (2010). 

The NSW vegetation map (version 2.2, Keith and Simpson 2006) was revised by interpreting additional candidate maps as vector layers and synthesising these into a single raster-based data set. This involved eight steps: developing a comprehensive 'standard' classification of vegetation classes for NSW; collating and standardising the projection and format of candidate source maps; assigning vegetation units of source maps to NSW vegetation classes; assessing the spatial resolution, currency and reliability of candidate source maps; assembling a composite map from candidate source maps to maximise reliability; applying a spatial mask to represent extant native vegetation; adjusting spatial resolution by dissolving small polygons and converting to 200 m raster; attributing the spatial resolution, currency and reliability of the underlying source data sets. 

The classification of 106 vegetation classes described by Keith (2004) was adopted as the framework for preparation of version 3.03 of the NSW vegetation map. Polygons from the ""Estuarine macrophytes CCA"" dataset of less than 0.1 ha were eliminated. For all other datasets polygons of less than 2 ha were eliminated. The map incorporates data from a statewide woody vegetation mask from the NSW Woody Vegetation Change Detection Program (Kitchen et al. 2010).

223,ua_leigh_marine_2012,Mapping habitats in a marine reserve showed how a 30-year trophic cascade altered ecosystem structure,english,"Time-series studies have reported trophic cascades in land, freshwater and marine environments in many geographic areas. However, the spatial extent of habitats, a key metric of ecosystem structure, has not been mapped in these studies. Marine reserves can provide experimental, before–after and inside–outside (control-impacted), situations for assessing the impact of fishing on ecosystems. We mapped seabed habitats and their associated communities (biotopes) in New Zealand’s oldest marine reserve for comparison with pre-reserve maps created about 30 years previously.
Areas grazed bare by sea urchins were entirely replaced in the centre of the reserve by kelp, or alga turf, an intermediate biotope between heavily grazed encrusting algae and lightly grazed kelp. Urchins declined following increased abundance and body size of spiny (rock) lobsters and fish (especially snapper) in the reserve but maintained bare rock outside. While this gradient in habitat change matched the gradient of predator abundance, it also matched the extent of reef habitat area. Thus the trophic cascade may be influenced by the effect of habitat on the abundance and behavioural interactions of urchins and their predators. Further ecosystem changes may arise should the abundance of mega-predators, such as seals, cetaceans and large sharks, increase in the region; if parasites become pathogenic; and/or when invasive species reach the reserve.
No-take marine reserves provide real-world experiments that show the importance of species in food webs, and the consequences of fishing for ecosystems. Because these changes in ecosystem structure may continue, and will vary with environment, climate and species distributions, reserves need to be permanent and replicated geographically.

Information relating to peatland ecosystem sub-types or habitat types was collated for peatland habitats listed under Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive, as well as degraded peatlands not included in EU nature conservation networks. While data relating to peatland condition were limited, understanding changes in ecosystem extent and incorporating knowledge of habitat types and degradation served as a proxy for ecosystem condition in the absence of more comprehensive data. This highlighted the importance of the ecosystem extent account, which underpins all other accounts in the SEEA EA framework.

The model performs relatively well against point observations but spatial gaps in the ground reference dataset mean that model uncertainty remains high, particularly in parts of Brazil and Bolivia. For example, we predict significant peatland areas in northern Peru with relatively high confidence, while peatland areas in the Rio Negro basin and adjacent south-western Orinoco basin which have previously been predicted to hold Campinarana or white sand forests, are predicted with greater uncertainty. Similarly, we predict large areas of peatlands in Bolivia, surprisingly given the strong climatic seasonality found over most of the country. Very little field data exists with which to quantitatively assess the accuracy of our map in these regions. Data gaps such as these should be a high priority for new field sampling. This new map can facilitate future research into the vulnerability of peatlands to climate change and anthropogenic impacts, which is likely to vary spatially across the Amazon basin.",Charles University; University of Edinburgh; Karlsruhe Institute for Technology; University of St. Andrews; Royal Botanical Gardens; Instituto de investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana; Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas (IVIC); Wageningen University & Research; University of California Santa Cruz; Stanford University; Herbario Universitario (PORT); Jardín Botánico de Bogotá José Celestino Mutis; Geosciences Barcelona; University of Leeds; Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana (UNAP); University of Liverpool; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina; San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance; University of Cambridge; National Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA),,TRUE,Unknown,"Hastie, A., Householder, J.

However, effective conservation and its potential to provide nature-based solutions to climate change is hindered by major uncertainties regarding seagrass extent and distribution. Here, we describe the characterization of the world’s largest seagrass ecosystem, located in The Bahamas. We integrate existing spatial estimates with an updated empirical remote sensing product and perform extensive groundtruthing of the seafloor with 2,542 diver surveys across remote sensing tiles. We also leverage seafloor assessments and movement data obtained from instrument-equipped tiger sharks, which have strong fidelity to seagrass ecosystems, to augment and further validate predictions. We report a consensus area of at least 66,000 km2 and up to 92,000 km2 of seagrass habitat across The Bahamas Banks. Sediment core analysis of stored organic carbon further confirmed the global relevance of the blue carbon stock in this ecosystem. Data from tiger sharks proved important in supporting mapping and groundtruthing remote sensing estimates.

At that time, national land cover maps were often inconsistent and incomparable across borders, making the prospect of monitoring the European environment at a continental scale all but impossible. In response, the European Commission launched the CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) program in an effort to develop a standardized methodology for producing continent-scale land cover, biotope, and air quality maps. In 1990, the first CORINE Land Cover dataset was produced. Since then, it has become a flagship component of the European Environment Agency’s Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, where it has provided essential information on European land cover/land use for over three decades.
In its current form, the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) product offers a pan-European land cover and land use inventory with 44 thematic classes, ranging from broad forested areas to individual vineyards.

Remote sensing provides a powerful resource of fundamental data at different spatial resolutions and spectral regions, making it an essential tool for vegetation mapping and biomass management. Due to the ever-increasing availability of free data and software, satellites have been predominantly used to map, analyze, and monitor natural resources for conservation purposes. This study aimed to map vegetation from Sentinel-2 (S2) data in a complex and mixed vegetation cover of the Lousã district in Portugal. We used ten multispectral bands with a spatial resolution of 10 m, and four vegetation indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). After applying principal component analysis (PCA) on the 10 S2A bands, four texture features, including mean (ME), homogeneity (HO), correlation (CO), and entropy (EN), were derived for the first three principal components. Textures were obtained using the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM). As a result, 26 independent variables were extracted from S2. After defining the land use classes using an object-based approach, the Random Forest (RF) classifier was applied. The map accuracy was evaluated by the confusion matrix, using the metrics of overall accuracy (OA), producer accuracy (PA), user accuracy (UA), and kappa coefficient (Kappa). The described classification methodology showed a high OA of 90.5% and kappa of 89% for vegetation mapping. Using GLCM texture features and vegetation indices increased the accuracy by up to 2%; however, classification using GLCM texture features and spectral bands achieved the highest OA (92%), indicating the texture features′ capability in detecting the variability of forest species at stand level. The ME and CO showed the highest contribution to the classification accuracy among the GLCM textures. GNDVI outperformed other vegetation indices in variable importance. Moreover, using only S2A spectral bands, especially bands 11, 12, and 2, showed a high potential to classify the map with an OA of 88%.

However, the higher spatial resolution makes it more laborious to collect training samples for efficient land-cover product updating. Fortunately, the existing historical products with a lower spatial resolution can be used as labels to achieve cross-resolution mapping with the latest images of a higher resolution. Although cross-resolution mapping can generate a large number of low-cost training labels, the labels can be noisy due to resolution mismatch or semantic errors. Furthermore, the existing deep learning based classification models have difficulty in maintaining the output resolution. In this article, a cross-resolution land-cover mapping framework with noisy label learning is proposed to complete high-resolution land-cover mapping based on noisy lower-resolution labels. The proposed method contains three parts: 1) To solve the resolution mismatch problem, the training labels are refined by modeling the spectral similarity and the spatial adjacency between the labels and the images using a conditional random field model. 2) To avoid the problem of resolution loss with the deep fully convolutional neural networks, a high-resolution deep semantic segmentation network is proposed to achieve deep feature extraction while maintaining the output resolution. 3) To eliminate the influence of semantic errors in the generated labels, a class-conditional label correction method is proposed, which detects and corrects the abnormal incorrect labels to facilitate network training. A national-scale land-cover mapping experiment for China was carried out.

To monitor and map these changes, a 26 general LULC class system was used. The classification system that was developed was primarily inspired by the ""Yangambi Classification"" (Trochain, 1957). This reasonably broad class system for LULC was used because the classes can be readily identified on Landsat satellite imagery.

Peat soils are formed by the build-up of partially decomposed organic matter under waterlogged anoxic conditions. Most peat is found in cool climatic regions where unimpeded decomposition is slower, but deposits are also found under some tropical swamp forests. Here we present field measurements from one of the world's most extensive regions of swamp forest, the Cuvette Centrale depression in the central Congo Basin. We find extensive peat deposits beneath the swamp forest vegetation (peat defined as material with an organic matter content of at least 65 per cent to a depth of at least 0.3 metres). Radiocarbon dates indicate that peat began accumulating from about 10,600 years ago, coincident with the onset of more humid conditions in central Africa at the beginning of the Holocene. The peatlands occupy large interfluvial basins, and seem to be largely rain-fed and ombrotrophic-like (of low nutrient status) systems. Although the peat layer is relatively shallow (with a maximum depth of 5.9 metres and a median depth of 2.0 metres), by combining in situ and remotely sensed data, we estimate the area of peat to be approximately 145,500 square kilometres (95 per cent confidence interval of 131,900-156,400 square kilometres), making the Cuvette Centrale the most extensive peatland complex in the tropics. This area is more than five times the maximum possible area reported for the Congo Basin in a recent synthesis of pantropical peat extent. We estimate that the peatlands store approximately 30.6 petagrams (30.6 × 10(15) grams) of carbon belowground (95 per cent confidence interval of 6.3-46.8 petagrams of carbon)-a quantity that is similar to the above-ground carbon stocks of the tropical forests of the entire Congo Basin. Our result for the Cuvette Centrale increases the best estimate of global tropical peatland carbon stocks by 36 per cent, to 104.7 petagrams of carbon (minimum estimate of 69.6 petagrams of carbon; maximum estimate of 129.8 petagrams of carbon).

The only recent available country-wide LC map of Iran was generated in 2016 by the Iranian Space Agency (ISA) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with a considerably low accuracy. Therefore, the production of an up-to-date and accurate Iran-wide LC map using the most recent remote sensing, machine learning, and big data processing algorithms is required. Moreover, it is important to develop an efficient method for automatic LC generation for various time periods without the need to collect additional ground truth data from this immense country. Therefore, this study was conducted to fulfill two objectives. First, an improved Iranian LC map with 13 LC classes and a spatial resolution of 10 m was produced using multi-temporal synergy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite datasets applied to an object-based Random forest (RF) algorithm. For this purpose, 2,869 Sentinel-1 and 11,994 Sentinel-2 scenes acquired in 2017 were processed and classified within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform allowing big geospatial data analysis.

The first map presents ecosystems at a level that is consistent with Levels 5 or 6 of the Global Ecosystem Typology (South African National Biodiversity Institute (2006- ). The Vegetation Map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, Mucina, L., Rutherford, M.C. and Powrie, L.W. (Editors), Online, https://bgis.sanbi.org/Projects/Detail/2258, Version 2024.). The South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) has cross referenced these ecosystems to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystems Typology. The result is a map of ecosystem functional groups at Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. 

The second layer contains spatial information on anthropogenic or human-modified terrestrial ecosystems, the European Space Agency’s WorldCover global landcover dataset.The ten landcover classes were cross-referenced to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. Of note, tree- and shrub-covered landscapes identified from landcover are reassigned to the underlying ecosystem functional group. This is because even if these ecosystems are covered by woody vegetation, they retain the same predominant ecological drivers of the underlying ecosystem (i.e. herbivory, fires, frost, seasonal precipitation). Similarly, bare ground is considered as degraded versions of the underlying ecosystems, rather than a distinct ecosystem functional group. Because the WorldCover dataset does not distinguish between natural and artificially planted tree cover, we extracted plantation data from the European Commission Joint Research Centre’s Global Map of Forest Types. Based on this, landcover and plantation information can be combined to identify human-modified ecosystem functional groups. 

The third layer contains spatial information on the distribution of freshwater ecosystems. For dams (Lehner, B., Beames, P., Mulligan, M. et al. (2024). The Global Dam Watch database of river barrier and reservoir information for large-scale applications. Sci Data 11, 1069), we distinguished between two ecosystem functional groups depending on the depth of the waterbody. Dams that were deeper than 15 m were classified as F3.1 Large Reservoirs.

The current study aims at improving knowledge on the types of terrestrial ecosystems present in Seychelles, their geographical distribution and their state of conservation, as a basis for the study of biodiversity and conservation patterns integrating species and ecosystem levels. A conceptual framework is presented (p.6-33) which integrates habitat-types within levels of organization of biodiversity and through different time scales. This allows to define types of ecosystems and to study their dynamics (especially their biotic variability) at a global scale (across continents, i.e. chorology) and through time (chronology). Terminology is reviewed according to international standards, with several improvements. Cartographic outputs are based on the concept of hierarchical mapping, i.e. where several thematic maps can be combined in different ways in order to produce different outputs according to specific needs. These thematic maps are produced based on a combination of methods, including modelling, field data, visual interpretation and supervised classification of remotely sensed images, and other GIS processes. The main output is a map of habitat-types which presents 31 classes (Figure 22, p.58). That map models the main environmental constraints (limiting factors) to which species have to adapt (even exotic species). Several other thematic maps allow assessing the conservation state of these habitat-types based on the current vegetation physiognomy, ecosystem development stage and naturalness. Finally, a simplified map of land cover types is proposed based on a combination of these thematic maps, or factors, and constitutes the second most important map result (Figure 24b, p. 62). Maps for all islands are provided in Annex 2. Ecosystem richness is the highest on Mahé and Silhouette, the former being also the most impacted by humans (8% natural) while the latter is the least impacted (51% natural). Naturalness is increasing with elevation: 9% in lowland, 19% in submontane, 46% in lower montane and 96% in tree fern lower montane belts (Table 10). Most of the coastal habitat-types have almost completely been transformed. The total current forest cover is estimated to ca. 10126 ha for the 5 islands (Annex 3). Anthropic lands cover ca. 6526 ha.

Our knowledge of the distribution of these habitats is largely incomplete, particularly in deeper water and at higher latitudes. The western continental shelf of Greenland is one example of a deep (more than 500 m) Arctic region with limited information available. This study uses an adaptation of the EUNIS seabed classification scheme to document benthic habitats in the region of the West Greenland shrimp trawl fishery from 60°N to 72°N in depths of 61–725 m. More than 2000 images collected at 224 stations between 2011 and 2015 were grouped into 7 habitat classes. A classification model was developed using environmental proxies to make habitat predictions for the entire western shelf (200–700 m below 72°N). The spatial distribution of habitats correlates with temperature and latitude. Muddy sediments appear in northern and colder areas whereas sandy and rocky areas dominate in the south. Southern regions are also warmer and have stronger currents. The Mud habitat is the most widespread, covering around a third of the study area. There is a general pattern that deep channels and basins are dominated by muddy sediments, many of which are fed by glacial sedimentation and outlets from fjords, while shallow banks and shelf have a mix of more complex habitats.

In this study, we used support vector machines (SVM) for modeling rare species distribution and we compared it to another emerging machine learning classifier called random forests (RF). The comparison was performed using three native and endemic plants found at low- to mid-elevation in the island of Moorea (French Polynesia, South Pacific) and considered rare because of scarce occurrence records: Lepinia taitensis (28 observed occurrences), Pouteria tahitensis (20 occurrences) and Santalum insulare var. raiateense (81 occurrences). We selected a set of biophysical variables to describe plant habitats in tropical high volcanic islands, including topographic descriptors and an overstory vegetation map. The former were extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) and the latter is a result of a SVM classification of spectral and textural bands from very high resolution Quickbird satellite imagery. Our results show that SVM slightly but constantly outperforms RF in predicting the distribution of rare species based on the kappa coefficient and the area under the curve (AUC) achieved by both classifiers. The predicted potential habitats of the three rare species are considerably wider than their currently observed distribution ranges.

However, the potential of GEE for forest resource management has not been fully exploited. To extract dominant woody plant species, GEE combined Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data with the addition of the National Forest Resources Inventory (NFRI) and topographic data, resulting in a 10 m resolution multimodal geospatial dataset for subtropical forests in southeast China. Spectral and texture features, red-edge bands, and vegetation indices of S1 and S2 data were computed. A hierarchical model obtained information on forest distribution and area and the dominant woody plant species. The results suggest that combining data sources from the S1 winter and S2 yearly ranges enhances accuracy in forest distribution and area extraction compared to using either data source independently. Similarly, for dominant woody species recognition, using S1 winter and S2 data across all four seasons was accurate. Including terrain factors and removing spatial correlation from NFRI sample points further improved the recognition accuracy. The optimal forest extraction achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 97.4% and a map-level image classification efficacy (MICE) of 96.7%.

The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge’s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5 m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil.

Since the Artificial Land Surface is mostly a mosaic of, for example, buildings, trees, roads, small-water bodies, and grasslands that are frequently combined, it makes data mining for identifying the artificial land surface more difficult. The Pixel-Object-Knowledge (POK）methodology was applied in this study and data development. The 30m dataset shows where and how many residents there are in cities and villages, as well as industrial lands, airports, and roads worldwide. The total area of the global artificial land surface is 1.1875 million km2, which is 0.88% of the total land surface of the world. The global data were organized into 750 tiles, according to the 5° (latitude) x 6° (longitude) within the region from 60°S to 60°N (674 tiles), and 5° (latitude) x 12° (longitude) within the region from 60°N to 80°N (76 tiles) (the Antarctic continent is not included). The data tiles are combined into 5 compressed data groups (Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Africa and Oceanic Countries), Four different data files comprise each of these data groups, they are: (1) land-surface water data (raster data with GeoTIFF format); (2) coordinate information data (TIFF WORD format); (3) areas of selected remote sensing data (.shp format); and (4) a metadata file (XML format). In addition, the 750 data file list, including the file names, corresponding geographic coordinates, and zoning codes are listed at the file.

By incorporating locally relevant ecological data, the original typology was refined to resolve issues of overgeneralization and spatial overlap. The resulting map delineates 20 distinct ecosystem types, offering improved spatial accuracy and better alignment with the actual land extent. To evaluate the potential of EFG classification, the RF model was trained on seasonal satellite composites and environmental variables, achieving an overall accuracy of 80%. Elevation and temperature were found to be the most influential predictors, effectively distinguishing ecological patterns across diverse landscapes. This integrated approach supports consistent tracking of ecosystem changes and helps address the limitations of static or infrequently updated spatial datasets.

Despite the increasing availability of such data at regional and national scales, the average ecologist has been limited in accessing them due to high requirements on computing power and remote sensing knowledge. We processed Denmark's publicly available national airborne laser scanning (ALS) data set acquired in 2014/15, together with the accompanying elevation model, to compute 70 rasterised descriptors of interest for ecological studies. With a grain size of 10 m, these data products provide a snapshot of high-resolution measures including vegetation height, structure and density, as well as topographic descriptors including elevation, aspect, slope and wetness across more than 40 000 km2 covering almost all of Denmark's terrestrial surface. The resulting data set is comparatively small (∼94 GB, compressed 16.8 GB), and the raster data can be readily integrated into analytical workflows in software familiar to many ecologists (GIS software, R, Python). Source code and documentation for the processing workflow are openly available via a code repository, allowing for transfer to other ALS data sets, as well as modification or re-calculation of future instances of Denmark's national ALS data set. We hope that our high-resolution ecological vegetation and terrain descriptors (EcoDes-DK15) will serve as an inspiration for the publication of further such data sets covering other countries and regions and that our rasterised data set will provide a baseline of the ecosystem structure for current and future studies of biodiversity, within Denmark and beyond.

Consequently, identifying their locations and extents is imperative. The stability, repeatability, cost-effectiveness, multi-scale coverage, and proper spatial resolution imagery of satellites provide a valuable opportunity for their use in various large-scale applications, such as provincial wetland mapping. To do so, it is required to (1) process and classify big geo data (i.e. a large amount of satellite datasets) in a time- and computationally-efficient approach and (2) collect a large amount of field samples. In this study, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning algorithms were utilized to process thousands of remote sensing images and produce provincial wetland inventory maps of the three Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). Additionally, using GEE, a generalized supervised classification method is proposed to produce a regional wetland map from a large area (e.g., a province) when lacking field samples. In fact, using the field data from only Manitoba and assuming that all wetlands in Canada have similar characteristics, the wetland maps were generated for the other two provinces.

Accurate and detailed mapping of the vegetation distribution on the TP is essential for an improved understanding of climate change effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, existing land cover datasets for the TP are either provided at a low spatial resolution or have insufficient vegetation types to characterize certain unique TP ecosystems, such as the alpine scree. Here, we produced a 10 m resolution TP land cover map with 12 vegetation classes and 3 non-vegetation classes for the year 2022 (referred to as TP_LC10-2022) by leveraging state-of-the-art remote-sensing approaches including Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, environmental and topographic datasets, and four machine learning models using the Google Earth Engine platform.

Upon comparing it with four existing global land cover products, TP_LC10-2022 showed significant improvements in terms of reflecting local-scale vertical variations in the southeast TP region. Moreover, we found that alpine scree, which is ignored in existing land cover datasets, occupied 13.99 % of the TP region, and shrublands, which are characterized by distinct forms (deciduous shrublands and evergreen shrublands) that are largely determined by the topography and are missed in existing land cover datasets, occupied 4.63 % of the TP region.

Land-cover classification maps of the Arctic regions are essential for monitoring and change detection purposes, as well as upscaling of various ecosystem processes. However, large-scale land cover maps of the Arctic regions are often too coarse to properly capture the heterogeneity of these landscapes. In this study, we bridge this gap through incorporating multi temporal Landsat-8 OLI data in a large-scale land cover classification, and subsequently produce a tundra classification map for the entire Greenland. An algorithm is developed that allows for the extraction of vegetation phenology from single-year time series of 4169 OLI scenes at 30 m resolution despite the low revisit frequency of the satellite and persistent cloud cover. The phenological metrics, satellite-derived wetness, and terrain information are then used to separate land surface classes using a random forest classifier. The optimal algorithm parameters and input layers are identified, ultimately yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 89.25% across the studied area. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis on the resulting land-cover map and for the first time presented the geographical distribution, latitudinal gradients, and climate linkages of the various tundra vegetation classes across the ice-free part of Greenland.

Here, across a large case study region in Goiás State, Brazil (1.1 Mha), we produced physiognomy level maps of native vegetation (n = 8) and other landcover types (n = 5). Seven different classification schemes using different combinations of input satellite imagery were used, with a Random Forest classifier and 2-stage approach implemented within Google Earth Engine. Overall classification accuracies ranged from 88.6–92.6% for native and non-native vegetation at the formation level (stage-1), and 70.7–77.9% for native vegetation at the physiognomy level (stage-2), across the seven different classifications schemes. The differences in classification accuracy resulting from varying the input imagery combination and quality control procedures used were small. However, a combination of seasonal Sentinel-1 (C-band synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (surface reflectance) imagery resulted in the most accurate classification at a spatial resolution of 20 m. Classification accuracies when using Landsat-8 imagery were marginally lower, but still reasonable. Quality control procedures that account for vegetation burning when selecting vegetation reference data may also improve classification accuracy for some native vegetation types.

Based on the analysis of rice backscattering characteristics in mainland Southeast Asia, the combination of spatiotemporal statistical features with good generalization ability was selected and then input into the U-Net semantic segmentation model, combined with WorldCover data to reduce false alarms, finally the 20 m resolution rice area map of five countries in mainland Southeast Asia in 2019 was obtained. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 92.20 % on the validation sample set, and the good agreement was obtained when comparing our rice area map with statistical data and other rice area maps at the national and provincial levels. The maximum coefficient of determination R2 was 0.93 at the national level and 0.97 at the provincial level. These results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in rice area mapping with complex cropping patterns and the reliability of the generated rice area maps.

This is the case for East African countries such as Rwanda, where agricultural expansion into wetlands and agricultural intensification are crucial elements of the government's strategy to increase food production and decrease dependence from global food markets. However, spatially explicit information of the location and status of wetlands for informed decision making is lacking or not up to date. In the related research article, we therefore develop a framework comprising the following spatial layers: Delineation, Surface Water Occurrence (SWO), Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification and Wetland Use Intensity (WUI). These layers are based on satellite imagery from the European Copernicus Programme and cover the whole of Rwanda. The Delineation is derived from a static Potential Wetlands layer and Sentinel-2 imagery using object-based image analysis (OBIA). The SWO is a per-pixel count of the times a location was detected as flooded using Sentinel-1 imagery. For the LULC classification, an object-based decision tree classifier is applied to Sentinel-2 imagery in Combination with the Delineation layer and the SWO. The WUI layer is based on the Absolute Mean Spectral Dynamics indicator depicting pixel-wise changes in reflectance values in Sentinel-2 bands relevant for wetland vegetation and hydrological dynamics. All layers refer to the year 2017, except for the SWO layer, which covers surface water dynamics from 2014 to 2017.

The annual cycle of formation, growth, decay and clearance of river ice can include low flows and ice jams, as well as mid-winter and spring break-up events. Reports and associated data on river ice occurrence are often limited to site and season specific studies. Within Canada, the National Hydrometric Program (NHP) operates a network of gauging stations with water level as the primary measured variable. It is well known by the hydrologic community that river ice related information can be extracted from water level records. Near two decades ago, the Water Science and Technology Directorate of Environment and Climate Change Canada initiated a long-term effort to compile, archive and extract river ice related information from hydrometric records. As a result, this work has delivered an original research data set: the Canadian River Ice Database (CRID). The CRID includes near 71,000 river ice variables from a network of 196 NHP sites throughout Canada in operation within the period 1894 to 2015. The task of compiling this database involved manual extraction, data entry and input of more than 460,000 information fields on water level, discharge, date, time and data quality rating. In excess of 100,000 paper and digital files were reviewed with the network representing over 10,000 station years of active operation. This database follows up on several earlier efforts to compile information on river ice and expands the scope and detail for use in Canadian river ice research and applications. At each location, time series of up to 15 river ice variables specific to occurrence of freeze-up and winter-low events, occurrence of mid-winter break-up, ice thickness, spring break-up and maximum open-water level is compiled.

Southeast Asia is an area of high species richness and endemicity under considerable anthropogenic threat with, unfortunately, scant focus on its lowland forests. We estimated extent of lowland forest loss from 1998 to 2018, including inside protected areas and determined the vulnerability of this remaining forest. Maximum likelihood classification techniques were used to classify Landsat images to estimate lowland forest cover in 1998 and 2018. We used Bayesian belief networks with 20 variables to evaluate vulnerability of the forest that remained in 2018. Analyses were conducted at two spatial scales: landscape patch (analogous to ecoregion) and country level. Over 20 years, >120,000 km2 of forest (50% of forest present in 1998) was lost. Of the 14 lowland forest patches, 6 lost >50% of their area. At the country scale, Cambodia had the greatest deforestation (>47,500 km2). In 2018, 18% of the lowlands were forested, and 20% of these forests had some formal protection. Approximately 50% of the lowland forest inside protected areas (c. 11,000 km2) was also lost during the study period. Most lowland forest remaining is highly vulnerable; eight landscape patches had >50% categorized as such.

A decade after its inception in the Digital Earth 2020 vision, GHSL is an established project of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and an integral part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The 2023 GHSL edition, a result of rigorous research on Earth Observation data and population censuses, contributes significantly to understanding worldwide human settlements. It introduces new elements like 10-m-resolution, sub-pixel estimation of built-up surfaces, global building height and volume estimates, and a classification of residential and non-residential areas, improving population density grids. This paper evaluates the key components of the GHSL, including the Symbolic Machine Learning approach, using novel reference data. These data enable a comparative assessment of GHSL model predictions on the evolution of built-up surface, building heights, and resident population. Empirical evidence suggests that GHSL estimates are the most accurate in the public domain today, e.g. achieving an IoU of 0.98 for the water class, 0.92 for the built-up class, and 0.8 for the non-residential class at 10 m resolution. At 100 m resolution, we find that the MAE of built-up surface estimates corresponds to 6% of the grid cell area, the MAE for the building height estimates is 2.27 m, and we find a total allocation accuracy of 83% for resident population.

300,lde_lesotho_eco_2025,Lesotho National Map of Ecosystem Types,english,"This map is composed of several layers. The first map presents ecosystems at a level that is consistent with Levels 5 or 6 of the Global Ecosystem Typology (South African National Biodiversity Institute (2006- ). The Vegetation Map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, Mucina, L., Rutherford, M.C. and Powrie, L.W. (Editors), Online, https://bgis.sanbi.org/Projects/Detail/2258, Version 2024.). The South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) has cross referenced these ecosystems to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystems Typology. The result is a map of ecosystem functional groups at Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. 

The second layer contains spatial information on anthropogenic or human-modified terrestrial ecosystems, based on Lesotho’s national landcover atlas (FAO. (2023). Lesotho: Land cover atlas 2017–2021. Maseru). This information presents ten landcover classes identified using satellite remote sensing. The ten landcover classes were cross-referenced to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. Of note, tree- and shrub-covered landscapes identified from landcover are reassigned to the underlying ecosystem functional group (which, in the case of Lesotho, is Temperate subhumid grasslands). This is because even if these ecosystems are covered by woody vegetation, they retain the same predominant ecological drivers of grasslands (i.e. grazing, fires, frost, seasonal precipitation). Similarly, erosion gullies are considered as degraded versions of the underlying ecosystems, rather than a distinct ecosystem functional group. Bare surfaces identified from satellite tend to represent exposed sandstone within grassland ecosystems, rather than a distinct ecosystem functional group. Based on this, landcover information can be used to identify human-modified ecosystem functional groups

The third layer contains spatial information on the distribution of freshwater ecosystems. For the F2.3. Seasonal Freshwater Lakes, the national land cover data was used (FAO. (2023). Lesotho: Land cover atlas 2017–2021. Maseru.). For dams (Lehner, B., Beames, P., Mulligan, M. et al. (2024). The Global Dam Watch database of river barrier and reservoir information for large-scale applications. Sci Data 11, 1069), we distinguished between two ecosystem functional groups depending on the depth of the waterbody. Dams that were deeper than 15 m were classified as F3.1 Large Reservoirs. Dams shallower than 15m were classified as F3.2 Constructed Lacustrine Wetlands. For rivers (Resource Quality Services (was IWQS) and Chief Directorate of National GeoSpatial Information (was Surveys and Mapping) (2012) Rivers of South Africa. Department of Water Affair, Pretoria, South Africa), permanent or perennial rivers were classified as F1.1. Permanent upland streams. Non-perennial streams and streams with unknown flow status were classified as F1.2 Seasonal upland streams. Wetlands identified from landcover data were all classified as F2.3 Seasonal freshwater lakes.

(Lecythidaceae), represents one of the main income-generation activities for local and indigenous people from the Brazilian Amazon region. Because trees of B. excelsa grow and bear fruit almost exclusively in natural forests, information on their spatial distribution is crucial for nut harvest planning. However, this information is difficult to obtain with traditional approaches such as ground-based surveys. Here, we show the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and WorldView-3 satellite images (pixel size = 30 cm) to map individual tree crowns (ITCs) and groves of B. excelsa in Amazonian forests. First, we manually outlined B. excelsa ITCs in the WorldView-3 images using field-acquired geolocation information. Then, based on ITC boundaries, we sequentially extracted image patches and selected 80% of them for training and 20% for testing. We trained the DeepLabv3+ architecture with three backbones: ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2. The average producer's accuracy was 93.87 ± 0.85%, 93.89 ± 1.6% and 93.47 ± 3.6% for ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2, respectively. We then developed a new random patch extraction training strategy and assessed how a reduction in the percentage of training patches impacted the classification accuracy. To illustrate the robustness of the new training strategy, similar F1-scores were achieved whether 80% or 10% of the total number of patches were used to train the CNN model. By analyzing the feature maps derived from ResNet-18, we found that the shadow of emergent B. excelsa trees are important for their discrimination. Geometric distortions in the WorldView-3 images resulting from extreme off-nadir viewing angles compromise the presence of shadows, thus potentially hampering B. excelsa detection. Our results show that ITCs and groves of B. excelsa can be mapped by integrating CNNs and very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite images, paving the way for monitoring this important tree species in large tracts of Amazonian forests.",Bioverse Tecnologia e Inovação em Monitoramento Ambiental and UNICEF Innovation Venture Fund,,FALSE,unknown,"Ferreira, Matheus Pinheiro, et al.

Although habitats will be inundated, ecosystems have the potential to shift inland, and endemic species may persist if conditions are favorable. Predictions of ecosystem migration due to sea level rise need to account for current stressors, which may reduce the resilience of these ecosystems. This study predicts the potential consequences of sea level rise on the groundwater-fed anchialine pool ecosystem in Hawaii. Scenarios of marine and groundwater inundation were compared with current patterns of habitat, introduced fishes, and land use. Results show that current habitats containing endemic anchialine shrimp will be increasingly inundated by marine waters. New habitats will emerge in areas that are low lying and undeveloped. Because of subsurface hydrologic connectivity, endemic shrimp are likely to populate these new habitats by moving through the coastal aquifer. In some areas, rising sea levels will provide surface connectivity between pools currently containing introduced fishes (tilapia, poeciliids) and up to 46 % of new or existing pools that do not contain these fish.

Our workflow evaluated temporally aggregated optical and radar satellite imagery and novel hydro-physiographic layers as inputs into a robust Random Forest (RF) machine learning (ML) algorithm. Both pixel and object-based classification approaches were assessed, whereby ML models were calibrated with a training dataset of sufficient and comprehensive samples. The study was conducted over Canada’s Southern Arctic ecozone (830,000 km2). GEE enabled the efficient preprocessing and classification of large volumes of EO data and resulted in excellent yet similar statistical performance for both pixel and object-based approaches, achieving overall accuracies of > 89 % and mean F1-scores of > 0.79. Moreover, McNemar tests indicated that these classifications were not statistically different, which has significant implications regarding computing time and processing efficiencies.

Peat (i.e., partially decomposed thick organic layers) accumulates due to the imbalance between plant production and decomposition often within saturated, nutrient deficient, and acidic soils, which limit decomposition.

In this study, we tested a simple geographic information system approach by overlaying Armenia’s landscape zones with land cover data from the Environmental Systems Research Institute and the European Space Agency. This analysis resulted in maps of 20 combinations of woody and non-woody land cover classes across 10 landscape zones, which we term landscape-land cover classes (LLCCs) and use as proxies for natural ecosystems. The LLCC-based method employed in this study accounts for the landscape and geographic specificity of terrestrial ecosystems, providing data on the extent of LLCCs within ecosystem accounting areas (EAAs), identifying rare LLCCs, and tracking changes in their extent following updates to land cover data. We found this approach applicable for assessing the extent and changes of LLCCs whose area exceeds the margin of error in land cover identification.

331,cas_global_rice_2025,Plot-Rice v1.0: A global plot-based rice benchmark dataset with spatiotemporal heterogeneity for scientific deep learning,english,"Satellite platforms have become the principal data source for large-scale rice mapping. Numerous studies investigated the advantages of integrating deep learning models with satellite data for rice mapping, but these studies are typically confined to specific regions and the quality of customized datasets varies. The absence of a global, standardized satellite dataset for rice mapping benchmarking has long resulted in both substantial redundant data processing efforts and challenges in evaluating new algorithms under a unified benchmark. To address these deficiencies, this paper introduces Plot-Rice v1.0, a global heterogeneous rice benchmark dataset based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, along with an automated framework that integrates SAR temporal features and leverages the foundation image segmentation model SAM-2 to generate plot-level rice samples. This framework effectively addresses the limitation of SAM-2, which supports zero-shot segmentation but lacks classification capabilities. Plot-Rice comprehensively accounts for the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of rice, incorporating plot-level rice labels and corresponding multi-source feature time series from 20 countries globally. In terms of feature composition, Plot-Rice integrates multi-source features, including radar backscattering coefficients, normalized backscattering coefficients, radar vegetation indices, spectral indices, and spectral combinations, constructing time series for 12 months of 2023 to facilitate temporal analysis. Finally, using this dataset, a series of benchmark experiments is conducted, encompassing performance comparisons of models such as U-Net, Res U-Net, Deeplabv3+, and HR-Net under multi-source feature time series, and comparisons of rice distribution extraction performance across diverse countries.

Each of the African regions has its unique physical and environmental limiting factors to accurate cropland mapping, which leads to high spatial discrepancies among remote sensing cropland products. Since no dataset could cope with all limitations, multiple datasets initially derived from various remote sensing sensors and classification techniques must be integrated into a more accurate cropland product than individual layers. Here, in the current study, four cropland products, produced initially from multiple sensors (e.g. Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and PROBA–V) to cover the period (2015–2017), were integrated based on their cropland mapping accuracy to build a more accurate cropland layer. The four cropland layers’ accuracy was assessed at Agro-ecological zones units via an intensive reference dataset (17,592 samples). The most accurate cropland layer was then identified for each zone to construct the final cropland mask at 30 m resolution for the nominal year of 2016 over Africa. As a result, the new layer was produced in higher cropland mapping accuracy (overall accuracy = 91.64% and cropland’s F-score = 0.75).

However, such understanding should preferably be updated at seasonal intervals for each agricultural system rather than relying on a single annual assessment. Here we present the European Space Agency-funded WorldCereal system, a global, seasonal, and reproducible crop and irrigation mapping system that addresses existing limitations in current global-scale crop and irrigation mapping. WorldCereal generates a range of global products, including temporary crop extent, seasonal maize and cereal maps, seasonal irrigation maps, seasonal active cropland maps, and model confidence layers providing insights into expected product quality. The WorldCereal product suite for the year 2021 presented here serves as a global demonstration of the dynamic open-source WorldCereal system. Validation of the products was done based on best available reference data per product. A global statistical validation for the temporary crop extent product resulted in user's and producer's accuracies of 88.5 % and 92.1 %, respectively. For crop type, a verification was performed against a newly collected street view dataset (overall agreement 82.5 %) and a limited number of publicly available in situ datasets (reaching minimum agreement of 80 %). Finally, global irrigated-area estimates were derived from available maps and statistical datasets, revealing the conservative nature of the WorldCereal irrigation product. The WorldCereal system provides a vital tool for policymakers, international organizations, and researchers to better understand global crop and irrigation patterns and to inform decision-making related to food security and sustainable agriculture.

The overall accuracy was 99.04 ± 0.21 %, which was significantly higher than the no-information rate.

The mapping entailed the delineation and classification of 3,736 open pits, waste rock dumps, water ponds, tailings storage facilities, heap leach pads, milling infrastructure and other features, totalling ~3,633 km2. Collectively, our maps highlight that mine areas can be highly heterogeneous in composition and diverse in form, reflecting variations in underlying geology, commodities produced, topography and mining methods. Our study therefore emphasises that distinguishing between specific mine features in satellite imagery may foster more refined assessments of mine-related impacts. We also compiled detailed annual data on the operational characteristics of 129 mines to show via regression analysis that the sum area of a mine's features is mainly explained by its cumulative production volume (cross-validated R2 of 0.73).

Yet current global road maps are typically outdated or characterized by spatial bias in coverage. In the Global Roads Inventory Project we gathered, harmonized and integrated nearly 60 geospatial datasets on road infrastructure into a global roads dataset. The resulting dataset covers 222 countries and includes over 21 million km of roads, which is two to three times the total length in the currently best available country-based global roads datasets. We then related total road length per country to country area, population density, GDP and OECD membership, resulting in a regression model with adjusted R2 of 0.90, and found that that the highest road densities are associated with densely populated and wealthier countries. Applying our regression model to future population densities and GDP estimates from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, we obtained a tentative estimate of 3.0–4.7 million km additional road length for the year 2050. Large increases in road length were projected for developing nations in some of the world’s last remaining wilderness areas, such as the Amazon, the Congo basin and New Guinea.

For those reasons, we developed a 30m spatial resolution  map of the terrestrial ecosystems of the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) and adjacent areas in Mexico and Canada based on the latest version of the U.S. National Vegetation Classification  (USNVC), which provides a comprehensive, hierarchical, standard, authoritative ecosystem  classification well suited for use in ecosystem mapping. The map builds on a previous map of ecosystems that was developed in a collaboration between NatureServe, a conservation NGO, and LANDFIRE, an interagency wildland fire management spatial data program that is supported and managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management and the U.S. Department of the Interior Office of Wildland Fire. The map  documents the USNVC group types, which are mid-level ecosystems of the 8-level USNVC hierarchy; 323 groups and eight additional land cover and anthropogenic land use categories are mapped across the entire map extent, with 308 groups present in CONUS. The USNVC v3.0 and NatureServe’s International Vegetation Classification (IVC) were recently aligned with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Ecosystem Typology (GET) in support of global ecosystem assessments. The GET is the reference classification for the Group  on Earth Observation’s (GEO) Global Ecosystem Atlas (GEA) initiative; thus, we can aggregate the USNVC map units to the GET ecosystem types for use by GEA for the U.S. portion of the Atlas. The USNVC is suitable for this product because it is the national standard for vegetation classification adopted by the Federal Geographic Data Committee, is maintained through peer review by the Ecological Society of America’s Vegetation Classification Panel, and provides a standard for the 50 states and other programs in the NatureServe Network.

After segmentation of fine resolution images, the first level of the OBIA-DT model established based on the collected field datasets (about 52,000 field data were collected) to build a light LULC map which broadly identified agricultural land components without differentiating between irrigated and non-irrigated cultivations.

We generated a baseline high-resolution land cover map of the agricultural zones and their surrounding protected areas. We combined the high spatial resolution of PlanetScope images with the high spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 images in an object-based classification using a RandomForest algorithm. We used images collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to verify and validate our classified map. Despite the astounding diversity and heterogeneity of the highland landscape, our classification yielded useful results (overall Kappa: 0.7, R2: 0.69) and revealed that across all four inhabited islands, invasive plants cover the largest fraction (28.5%) of the agricultural area, followed by pastures (22.3%), native vegetation (18.6%), food crops (18.3%), and mixed forest and pioneer plants (11.6%). Our results are consistent with historical trajectories of colonization and abandonment of the highlands. The produced dataset is designed to suit the needs of practitioners of both conservation and agriculture and aims to foster collaboration between the two areas.",University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,,TRUE,CC BY 4.0,"Laso, F.

The CLC is primarily funded by the Florida’s State Wildlife Grants program in support of The Florida State Wildlife Action Plan which identified improved habitat mapping as a priority data gap.

Beginning with the release of CLC v3.0, the Cooperative Land Cover Map will be revised continuously, with new versions released annually. FWC will now take lead on updating and maintaining the Cooperative Land Cover map. FNAI will continue to provide guidance for the classification of natural communities, and site specific data sources based on their mapping and revision efforts. The CLC follows the Florida Land Cover Classification System.

370,snu_sthkorea_eco_2023,A Study on the Application of IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology Using Land Cover Map in Korea,korean,"Over the past few centuries, widespread changes to natural ecosystems caused by human activities have severely threatened biodiversity worldwide. Understanding changes in ecosystems is essential to identifying and managing threats to biodiversity. In line with this need, the IUCN Council formed the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (GET) in 2019, taking into account the functions and types of ecosystems. The IUCN provides maps of 10 ecosystem groups and 108 ecological functional groups (EFGs) on a global scale. According to the type classification of IUCN GET ecosystems, Korea’s ecosystem is classified into 8 types of Realm (level 1), 18 types of Biome (level 2), and 41 types of Group (level 3).

GETs provided by IUCN have low resolution and often do not match the actual land status because it was produced globally. This study aimed to increase the accuracy of Korean IUCN GET type classification by using land cover maps and producing maps that reflected the actual situation. To this end, we ① reviewed the Korean GET data system provided by IUCN GET and ② compared and analyzed it with the current situation in Korea. We evaluated the limitations and usability of the GET through the process and then ③ classified Korea’s new Get type reflecting the current situation in Korea by using the national data as much as possible. This study classified Korean GETs into 25 types by using land cover maps and existing national data (Territorial realm: 9, Freshwater: 9, Marine-territorial: 5, Terrestrial-freshwater: 1, and Marine-freshwater-territorial: 1). Compared to the existing map, “F3.2 Constructed lacustrine wetlands”, “F3.3 Rice paddies”, “F3.4 Freshwater aquafarms”, and “T7.3 Plantations” showed the largest area reduction in the modified Korean GET. The area of “T2.2 Temperate Forests” showed the largest area increase, and the “MFT1.3 Coastal saltmarshes and reedbeds” and “F2.2 Small permanent freshwater lakes” types also showed an increase in GET area after modification. Through this process, the existing map, in which the sum of all EFGs in the existing GET accounted for 8.33 times the national area, was modified so that the total sum becomes 1.22 times the national area using the land cover map. This study confirmed that the existing EFG, which had small differences by type and low accuracy, was improved and corrected. This study is significant in that it produced a GET map of Korea that met the GET standard using data reflecting the field conditions.",Seoul National University; National Institute of Ecology,,FALSE,unknown,"Sohn, H.-J., Won, S.-Y., Jeon, J.-E., Park, E.-H., Kim, D.-H., Han, S.-H. & Song, Y.-K.

Each record in the dataset represents a known or inferred search effort for a specific species at a specific geographic site in a specific breeding season, with information on whether a species was directly reported as present, absent, or no direct statement about presence-absence at the site was made (occupancy non-reporting). A published spatial reference system (Southwell et al. 2021) was used to accurately and consistently geo-reference search effort and occupancy observations. The basic spatial unit for this system is a geographic site of ice-free land (a discrete island or continental rock outcrop surrounded by ocean or glacial ice). Occupancy observations were sourced by searching the primary literature, secondary literature, the AADC, drawing from the seabird research community’s knowledge of published and unpublished records, and leveraging the community’s practical experience in the region. Decision criteria were established to infer presence and absence certainty, and identify sites where there was no knowledge of presence or absence. These inferences drawn from the criteria were validated where possible by the researchers who collected the data. The compilation was used to investigate questions of pattern, bias and certainty in seabird breeding distribution.
