2,aad_macqis_veg_2015,2,Macquarie Island Vegetation and Drainage Structure Data Set,"The data for this map were collected as part of two ASAC projects - 488 and 956, of which Patricia Selkirk was the chief investigator. Macquarie Island (54 degrees S 159 degrees E) is a subantarctic island (c. 35km by 3 to 5km) approximately equidistant between Tasmania, New Zealand and Antarctica in the Southern Ocean. The vegetation is herbaceous, lacking shrubs and trees. Vegetation and drainage are mapped at a scale of 1:25 000 from field observations, satellite imagery and limited oblique and aerial photography. The categories adopted for mapping vegetation are based on attributes of foliage height and percentage foliage cover of the ground surface (vegetation structure), not on species distribution (floristics). The distribution of vegetation categories is strongly correlated with aspect, topography and rock type. Mires, streams and lakes form an intricate drainage pattern that is strongly influenced by the geology of this tectonically active emergent crest of the submarine Macquarie Ridge at the boundary of the Pacific and Australian plates. The drainage pattern of the whole island is represented in a map with substantially greater accuracy than in any previous map.",Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC),,"Selkirk, P., Adamson, D. and Harris, U.

8,des_qld_veg_2021,1,Remnant 2021 broad vegetation groups - Queensland,"The State of Queensland in northeast Australia covers 1.73 million square kilometres and encompasses a wide variety of landscapes across temperate, wet and dry tropics and semiarid to arid climatic zones. Currently (April 2023), 1435 regional ecosystems are recognised across Queensland. Regional ecosystems are defined and mapped at 1:100,000 scale across the state. Many regional ecosystems include one or more vegetation communities, some of which are only recognised and mapped at scales larger than 1:100,000. A vegetation community is an association within a regional ecosystem that has similar structure and floristics and occurs within the same land zone. Broad Vegetation Groups (BVGs) are a higher-level grouping of vegetation communities and regional ecosystems. 

BVGs provide an overview of vegetation across the state or a bioregion. They are a useful addition to the regional ecosystem framework by providing an overview of major ecological patterns and relationships across Queensland, independent of bioregions and land zones, and facilitate comparisons with vegetation in other states and internationally. The primary aim of this document is to concisely describe the BVGs of Queensland to enhance their use in government planning, policy and regulation, e.g., vegetation offsets, Bushfire Hazard Area mapping, public education and scientific investigations. Floristic, structural, functional, biogeographic and landscape attributes have all been used in the BVG classification. The first aggregation of BVGs in the hierarchical classification is determined on the basis of vegetation structure (cover, height and growth form) of the ecologically dominant layer. BVGs are ordered broadly to reflect the vegetation structure along a mesic gradient from wet closed forests (rainforests) of the coast and north east, to the arid spinifex hummock grasslands of the south west.",Department of Environment and Science (Queensland),,"Department of Environment and Science (2021), Remnant 2021 broad vegetation groups - Queensland [dataset].

9,aca_global_reef_2022,3,Allen Coral Atlas,"The Allen Coral Atlas is built by a dedicated team of scientists, technologists, and conservationists, using one-of-a-kind methodologies. The Allen Coral Atlas was conceived and funded by the late Paul Allen’s Vulcan Inc. and is managed by the Arizona State University Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science. Along with partners from Planet, the Coral Reef Alliance, and the University of Queensland, the Atlas utilizes high-resolution satellite imagery and advanced analytics to map and monitor the world’s coral reefs in unprecedented detail. The partnership together identified the following methods for habitat map creation, dynamic monitoring, and other related coral reef products. 

As part of the Allen Coral Atlas’s revisions to its habitat maps in 2022, a new reef extent product was generated for each mapping region. In context of this product, reef extent is defined as the location of shallow coral reef features that can generally be seen from satellites. It typically excludes areas of very deep and very turbid water. This is intended to provide a more generalized and inclusive layer that depicts the extent of the coral reef environment which is additional to the Atlas’ geomorphic zonation maps. The reef extent data product can be seen as a single layer on the Atlas and compared and analyzed alongside other datasets such as reef habitat maps and reef threat monitoring datasets. 

The underlying reef extent product is a raster at 5m pixel resolution, matching the geomorphic and benthic map products. The raster combines three sources:

1. The extent of the Allen Coral Atlas’s 12 geomorphic zones

2. The extent of our own machine learning-based coral reef habitat layer, originally developed for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network’s 2020 Report on the Status of Coral Reefs of the World

3. A third extent layer that: Filled in holes greater than 400 pixels (0.64Ha) and applied a morphological filter (circle kernel of 5 pixels; 25m) to smooth the reef boundaries and regain missing slope/beach features..

For the purposes of the data product made visible on the Allen Coral Atlas, these three sources are combined into one single-colored layer.

The reef extent layer more inclusively depicts the shallow coral reef environment than our more detailed benthic or geomorphic habitat maps. It includes reef features that were unmappable to geomorphic/benthic level, including deeper reef structures, reef habitat in more turbid water, deep or very steep reef slope areas, and very shallow intertidal areas at the land-sea interface. Known limitations are that some areas of supra-tidal beach and vegetation are included, which may not strictly be coral reef environments. Overall, the reef extent product is still conservative, and we expect that the area of reef erroneously included at the land-sea interface is greatly outweighed by the areas of reef still missed at both the shallow and deep margins of the product.",Allen Coral Atlas Partnership; University of New South Wales; University of Queensland; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; Coral Reef Alliance; Arizona State University; National Geographic Society,,"Allen Coral Atlas (2022).

Recent advances in cloud-based geospatial platforms have enabled the development of an analysis pipeline to monitor saltmarsh distribution at a continental scale. Our remote sensing pipeline builds on work to develop the first integrated global maps of tidal flat, saltmarsh and mangrove ecosystems. 

We are first compiling a large set of occurrence records to train our remote sensing classification models (at least 10,000 point records across Australia's coastline). Our training set includes field data acquired from Australia's saltmarsh research community, published papers and records developed from high-resolution image interpretation conducted at JCU's Global Ecology Lab. 

Our remote sensing classification approach uses up to 100 nationwide remote sensing-derived covariate layers to support a suite of machine-learning classification models. The classification models are tasked with estimating the coastal ecosystem type of every 30-m pixel that occurs around Australia's coastal zone. This mapping framework will be implemented as a collaborative effort between JCU, UNSW and Digital Earth Australia.

The study used a map-to-image approach to change detection where the baseline map (GMW v2.5) was updated using thresholding and a contextual mangrove change mask. This approach was applied between all image-date pairs producing 10 maps for each epoch, which were summarised to produce the global mangrove time-series. The resulting mangrove extent maps had an estimated accuracy of 87.4 % (95th conf. int.: 86.2 - 88.6 %), although the accuracies of the individual gain and loss change classes were lower at 58.1 % (52.4 - 63.9 %) and 60.6 % (56.1 - 64.8 %), respectively. Sources of error included a mis-registration in the SAR mosaic datasets, which could only be partially corrected for, but also confusion in fragmented areas of mangroves, such as around aquaculture ponds. Overall, 152,604 km2 (133,996 - 176,910) of mangroves were identified for 1996, with this decreasing by -5,245 km2 (-13,587 - 3686) resulting in a total extent of 147,359 km2 (127,925 - 168,895) in 2020, and representing an estimated loss of 3.4 % over the 24-year time period.

16,cambridge_global_saltmarsh_2023,1,The distribution of global tidal marshes from earth observation data,"Tidal marsh ecosystems are heavily impacted by human activities, highlighting a pressing need to address gaps in our knowledge of their distribution. To better understand the global distribution and changes in tidal marsh extent, and identify opportunities for their conservation and restoration, it is critical to develop a spatial knowledge base of their global occurrence. 

Here, we develop a globally consistent tidal marsh distribution map for the year 2020 at 10-m resolution. To map the location of the world’s tidal marshes we applied a random forest classification model to earth observation data from the year 2020. We trained the classification model with a reference dataset developed to support distribution mapping of coastal ecosystems, and predicted the spatial distribution of tidal marshes between 60°N to 60°S. We validated the tidal marsh map using standard accuracy assessment methods, with our final map having an overall accuracy score of 0.852. We estimate the global extent of tidal marshes in 2020 to be 52,880 km2 (95% CI: 32,030 to 59,780 km2) distributed across 120 countries and territories. Tidal marsh distribution is centred in temperate and Arctic regions, with nearly half of the global extent of tidal marshes occurring in the temperate Northern Atlantic (45%) region. At the national scale, over a third of the global extent (18,510 km2; CI: 11,200 – 20,900) occurs within the USA. Our analysis provides the most detailed spatial data on global tidal marsh distribution to date and shows that tidal marshes occur in more countries and across a greater proportion of the world’s coastline than previous mapping studies. Our map fills a major knowledge gap regarding the distribution of the world’s coastal ecosystems and provides the baseline needed for measuring changes in tidal marsh extent and estimating their value in terms of ecosystem services.",University of Cambridge; University of Siena; The Nature Conservancy; James Cook University,,"Worthington, T.

The objective of this technical note is to update the previously published SDPT in three areas: boundaries, to spatially differentiate planted trees on a global scale; tree species information, to help screen for the illegal exportation of timber products; and carbon sequestration rates, or removal factors, to improve maps of atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration by planted trees.

Key Findings:

213,nswgov_nsw_veg_2012,1,Vegetation Formations and Classes of NSW (version 3.03 - 200m Raster),"This vegetation map shows the extant distributions of vegetation classes throughout NSW, and provides users with information about the resolution, currency and uncertainties in the underlying data that were used to assemble the map. Data represents NSW native vegetation extent, compiled from various vegetation maps using methods outlined in Simpson et al. (2011) and in Keith and Simpson (2010). 

The NSW vegetation map (version 2.2, Keith and Simpson 2006) was revised by interpreting additional candidate maps as vector layers and synthesising these into a single raster-based data set. This involved eight steps: developing a comprehensive 'standard' classification of vegetation classes for NSW; collating and standardising the projection and format of candidate source maps; assigning vegetation units of source maps to NSW vegetation classes; assessing the spatial resolution, currency and reliability of candidate source maps; assembling a composite map from candidate source maps to maximise reliability; applying a spatial mask to represent extant native vegetation; adjusting spatial resolution by dissolving small polygons and converting to 200 m raster; attributing the spatial resolution, currency and reliability of the underlying source data sets. 

The classification of 106 vegetation classes described by Keith (2004) was adopted as the framework for preparation of version 3.03 of the NSW vegetation map. Polygons from the ""Estuarine macrophytes CCA"" dataset of less than 0.1 ha were eliminated. For all other datasets polygons of less than 2 ha were eliminated. The map incorporates data from a statewide woody vegetation mask from the NSW Woody Vegetation Change Detection Program (Kitchen et al. 2010). 

The map is presented as a raster within an ESRI ArcGIS (9.3) geodatabase. Supersedes Keith and Simpson (2006), Keith (2004) and Pressey et al. (2000). Pressey et al. (2000) was the native veg extent product used to calculate native veg cover values for the Over-Cleared Landscapes Database prior to July 2006.

The South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) has cross referenced these ecosystems to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystems Typology. The result is a map of ecosystem functional groups at Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. 

The second layer contains spatial information on anthropogenic or human-modified terrestrial ecosystems, the European Space Agency’s WorldCover global landcover dataset.The ten landcover classes were cross-referenced to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. Of note, tree- and shrub-covered landscapes identified from landcover are reassigned to the underlying ecosystem functional group. This is because even if these ecosystems are covered by woody vegetation, they retain the same predominant ecological drivers of the underlying ecosystem (i.e. herbivory, fires, frost, seasonal precipitation). Similarly, bare ground is considered as degraded versions of the underlying ecosystems, rather than a distinct ecosystem functional group. Because the WorldCover dataset does not distinguish between natural and artificially planted tree cover, we extracted plantation data from the European Commission Joint Research Centre’s Global Map of Forest Types. Based on this, landcover and plantation information can be combined to identify human-modified ecosystem functional groups. 

The third layer contains spatial information on the distribution of freshwater ecosystems. For dams (Lehner, B., Beames, P., Mulligan, M. et al. (2024). The Global Dam Watch database of river barrier and reservoir information for large-scale applications.

However, such rapid and disordered expansion posed risks to coastal environment, economic development, and biodiversity protection. This study aimed to produce an accurate national-scale marine aquaculture map at a spatial resolution of 16 m, using a proposed model based on deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) and applied it to satellite data from China's GF-1 sensor in an end-to-end way. The analyses used homogeneous CNNs to extract high-dimensional features from the input imagery and preserve information at full resolution. Then, a hierarchical cascade architecture was followed to capture multi-scale features and contextual information. This hierarchical cascade homogeneous neural network (HCHNet) was found to achieve better classification performance than current state-of-the-art models (FCN-32s, Deeplab V2, U-Net, and HCNet). The resulting marine aquaculture area map has an overall classification accuracy > 95 % (95.2 %–96.4, 95 % confidence interval). And marine aquaculture was found to cover a total area of ∼ 1100 km2 (1096.8–1110.6 km2, 95 % confidence interval) in China, of which more than 85 % is marine plant culture areas, with 87 % found in the Fujian, Shandong, Liaoning, and Jiangsu provinces.

Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) enables all-day and all-weather observations of rice distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. The complexity of rice cultivation patterns in tropical and subtropical regions makes it difficult to construct a representative data-relevant rice crop model, increasing the difficulty in extracting rice distributions from SAR data. To address this problem, a rice area mapping method for large regional tropical or subtropical areas based on time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data is proposed in this study. Based on the analysis of rice backscattering characteristics in mainland Southeast Asia, the combination of spatiotemporal statistical features with good generalization ability was selected and then input into the U-Net semantic segmentation model, combined with WorldCover data to reduce false alarms, finally the 20 m resolution rice area map of five countries in mainland Southeast Asia in 2019 was obtained. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 92.20 % on the validation sample set, and the good agreement was obtained when comparing our rice area map with statistical data and other rice area maps at the national and provincial levels. The maximum coefficient of determination R2 was 0.93 at the national level and 0.97 at the provincial level.

These 1:50,000 scale maps cover more than 60 classes of natural and man-made vegetation including various forest types, but also details on logged-over areas, peat swamps, heath forest, oil palm estate, various mixed agroforestry systems, mosaics of fallows and smallholder agriculture. The vegetation maps were generated using Landsat satellite images (2019). Landscapes are pre-stratified according to climate, geomorphology, types of soil, catchment areas and elevation classes, and interpretation is a combination of supervised classification and manual digitization on screen. The work is supplemented by extensive ground checking with detailed ecological surveys. The various types are denoted using colour coding and symbols based on the cartographic principles of ecological mapping, one colour representing one vegetation type and its succession. For example, a solid green colour is assigned to lowland forest and its first degradation level, logging, is represented with green mixed with horizontal white stripes, indicating the depletion of the original forest type. These large-scale vegetation maps are important sources of information for land allocation and ecosystem-based management, both for the private and public sectors and help as well recognize potential areas or specific forest types or High Conservation Value forest for conservation.
