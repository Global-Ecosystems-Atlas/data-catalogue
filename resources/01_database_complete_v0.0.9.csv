1,uf_arctic_veg_2022,active,11/03/2024,Nicholas_Murray,Raster Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map Version 2,english,"The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM) shows the types of vegetation that occur across the Arctic—between the Arctic Ocean to the north and the northern limit of forests (“treeline”) to the south. Here, environmental and climatic conditions are extreme, with a short growing season and low summer temperatures.

The region supports plants such as dwarf shrubs, herbs, lichens and mosses, which grow close to the ground. As one moves southward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth increases , allowing the size, abundance, and variety of plants to increase. Other environmental controls, such as elevation, topography, soil chemistry, soil moisture, and the past history of plant colonization, also influence the distribution of plant communities. The colors on the map indicate the differences that occur in the outward appearance of vegetation.

An international team of Arctic vegetation scientists representing the six countries of the Arctic—Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and the United States—prepared the map. Methods, additional thematic maps, detailed descriptions of the 16 map units, and photos of representative plant communities and species are on the reverse side. Get a more detailed overview at About the CAVM.

The Raster Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (Raster CAVM) map groups over 400 described plant communities into 16 vegetation types, glaciers, saline water, and freshwater at 1-km resolution. It builds on the strengths of the original CAVM, using the same legend, extent and projection, while providing a finer spatial resolution, raster format, and improved mapping of Arctic vegetation.","Land cover maps are the basic data layer required for understanding and modeling ecological patterns and processes. The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM), produced in 2003, has been widely used as a base map for studies in the arctic tundra  . However, the relatively coarse resolution and vector format of the map were not compatible with many other data sets. We present a new version of the CAVM, building on the strengths of the original map, while providing a finer spatial resolution, raster format, and improved mapping. The Raster CAVM uses the legend, extent and projection of the original CAVM. The legend has 16 vegetation types, glacier, saline water, freshwater, and non-arctic land. The Raster CAVM divides the original rock-water-vegetation complex map unit that mapped the Canadian Shield into two map units, distinguishing between areas with lichen- and shrub-dominated vegetation. In contrast to the original hand-drawn CAVM, the new map is based on unsupervised classifications of seventeen geographic/floristic sub-sections of the Arctic, using AVHRR and MODIS data (reflectance and NDVI) and elevation data. The units resulting from the classification were modeled to the CAVM types using a wide variety of ancillary data. The map was reviewed by experts familiar with their particular region, including many of the original authors of the CAVM from Canada, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard), Russia, and the U.S. The analysis presented here summarizes the area, geographical distribution, elevation, summer temperatures, and NDVI of the map units. The greater spatial resolution of the Raster CAVM allowed more detailed mapping of water-bodies and mountainous areas. It portrays coastal-inland gradients, and better reflects the heterogeneity of vegetation type distribution than the original CAVM. Accuracy assessment of random 1-km pixels interpreted from 6 Landsat scenes showed an average of 70 % accuracy, up from 39 % for the original CAVM. The distribution of shrub-dominated types changed the most, with more prostrate shrub tundra mapped in mountainous areas, and less low shrub tundra in lowland areas. This improved mapping is important for quantifying existing and potential changes to land cover, a key environmental indicator for modeling and monitoring ecosystems.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Raynolds, Martha; Walker, Donald (2022), “Raster Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map”, Mendeley Data, V2",2022,TRUE,NA,NA,CC BY NC 3.0,https://creativecommons.org/licences/by-nc/3.0/,NA,https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c4xj5rv6kv/2,https://doi.org/10.17632/c4xj5rv6kv.2,NA,TRUE,Various,Continental,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Macquarie Island (54 degrees S 159 degrees E) is a subantarctic island (c. 35km by 3 to 5km) approximately equidistant between Tasmania, New Zealand and Antarctica in the Southern Ocean. The vegetation is herbaceous, lacking shrubs and trees. Vegetation and drainage are mapped at a scale of 1:25 000 from field observations, satellite imagery and limited oblique and aerial photography. The categories adopted for mapping vegetation are based on attributes of foliage height and percentage foliage cover of the ground surface (vegetation structure), not on species distribution (floristics). The distribution of vegetation categories is strongly correlated with aspect, topography and rock type. Mires, streams and lakes form an intricate drainage pattern that is strongly influenced by the geology of this tectonically active emergent crest of the submarine Macquarie Ridge at the boundary of the Pacific and Australian plates. The drainage pattern of the whole island is represented in a map with substantially greater accuracy than in any previous map.","INTRODUCTION
The vegetation of Macquarie Island reflects its isolation in the Southern Ocean, low average summer temperature, extremely strong winds, and the island's geology and hydrology. The island, 34km north-south by 2-5km east-west, comprises an undulating plateau bounded by steep coast-facing slopes and cliffs. Drainage on the island is complex and, to date, poorly mapped. The balance between surface and underground flow of water has profound effects on streams, lakes and on the distribution of structural vegetation types.
Isolation and Flora. At 54° S 159° E Macquarie Island is approximately 1500km south east of Tasmania, 1000km south west of New Zealand. It is one of only seven subantarctic islands or island groups close to the Polar Front in the Southern Ocean. It has never been part of or close to a continental land mass. Its entire flora has arrived by long distance, over-ocean dispersal. The vascular plant flora is small, 46 species (Hnatiuk 1993), and shows strong similarities to the floras of other subantarctic islands, to New Zealand and , less strongly, to Australia (Selkirk et al 1990). Non-vascular plants constitute an important part of the Macquarie Island flora: 83 species of mosses, 51 species of liverworts (Selkirk et al 1990), 141 species of lichens (Kantvilas and Seppelt 1992), at least 400 species of non-marine algae (T.P. McBride pers. comm.).
Low average summer temperature. Substantial woody growth is commonly found where the average temperature for three summer months exceeds 10° C. In common with other subantarctic islands, summer temperature on Macquarie Island (6.7° C mean 1948-86, Jacka, Christou and Cook 1984) is such that little woody growth is produced. The largest terrestrial plants, the non-woody tussock grass, Poa foliosa and the forb Stilbocarpa polaris, reach about 1.5m tall. Most plants are non woody and shorter than about 0.3m, but three species, Coprosma perpusilla, Acaena magellanica and A. minor, produce woody creeping stems up to about 0.5cm diameter.
Strong winds. The severe climatic conditions result in a dynamic interaction between plants and landforms. Wind, snow, ice and water produce active erosion even on low slopes. Complex vegetation patterns occur over small distances, for example areas with high percentage of bare ground (feldmark) adjoin areas where the vegetation cover is complete.
Geology. In the northern third of the island is a large area where the extremely sparse vegetation is explained by the presence of rock types which produce soil unfavourable for plant growth (Adamson et al 1993). Most of the southern two thirds of the island is a thick pile of pillow lavas and pyroclastic rocks whose intense fracturing promotes rapid infiltration of water. Bedding and faulting influence the flow of groundwater. As a result, areas of groundwater intake are generally well drained, while areas of outflow have abundant mires.
Hydrology. Surface and underground flow of water is strongly influenced by geological features. Fault-bounded escarpments frequently control the direction of streams and location of lakes (Ledingham and Peterson 1984). Faults and fractures channel groundwater. Vegetation in lakes includes Myriophyllum triphyllum, various bryophytes, and abundant algae including at least 250 species of diatoms.
Bare ground. On steep slopes between the plateau (altitude 100-400m a.s.l) and the coast, and on the plateau itself, bare ground is common. Strong wind, rain, sleet, and snow cause abrasion of plants and the bare ground. The progressive accumulation of peat, even on gentle slopes, results in mass movement of soil and its vegetation (Selkirk 1996). The resultant scars are subject to accelerated erosion and slow colonisation (Scott 1985).
Nearshore marine vegetation. Offshore, the algal vegetation is dense. Brown algae grow to many metres in length. Southern kelps, particularly the bull kelp, Durvillaea antarctica, from the high tide limit to more than 15m depth, and Macrocystis pyrifera, form impressive masses of floating fronds, particularly prominent along the sheltered eastern coast. The great size of individual marine algal plants contrasts with the short stature of the terrestrial vegetation.
THE MAP
This map depicts, at a scale of 1:25 000, distribution of structural vegetation categories, with emphasis on height of the vegetation above the ground, and its density, defined as % of the ground surface covered by plants. The map does not show the distribution of species, nor does it attempt to establish and then map plant associations or comparable categories which reflect communities of plant species.
Taylor (1955) mapped the vegetation of the whole island at small scale (approx. 1:63000, i.e. 1 inch to the mile), and the northern quarter at approx. 1:22000, using four essentially structural categories: wet tussock, subglacial herbfield, feldmark, bare ground. In the text accompanying the map he took a phytosociological approach, dividing the Macquarie Island vegetation into five main formations: grassland, herbfield, fen, bog and feldmark. Within each formation he described one or more alliances, associations and sub-associations. Since his pioneering work some aerial photography and satellite imagery have become available, much additional field work has been done, and a fuller assessment is now possible of environmental controls. Copson (1984) plotted the distribution of vascular plant species for the whole island on a 1 km x 1 km grid, showing the wide distribution of many species.
In preparing this map, we have used as a basis the SPOT 3 merged pan/multispectral image of 22 December 1994 and the coastline prepared from this image by AUSLIG. We have consulted the black and white aerial photography of 6 and 7 February 1976, runs CAS 5465, CAS 8467 to 8473 and CAS 8480 to 8483. We have drawn extensively on our fieldwork and on our own and colleagues' field notes and photographs.
Although the present map is more detailed and at a larger scale than previous studies, it is preliminary. Its most important role is as a basis for more detailed work in the future. Detailed work is probably best carried out on carefully selected small areas of the island where mapping and other data gathering can be done at high resolution. Knowledge of the present vegetation is needed to assess the consequences of environmental change including the effects that the planned eradication of cats will have on burrow-nesting bird and rabbit populations, and in turn on vegetation.
The topographic map of Macquarie Island (Division of National Mapping 1971) is inaccurate with respect to the drainage system of lakes and streams (Selkirk and Adamson 1995). The map prepared by Blake in 1911-14 (Mawson 1943) is more accurate than the 1971 map. The geological maps of Macquarie Island (Tasmanian Geological Survey 1998) include more detailed representations of drainage than Blake's map or the topographic map. Although less detailed in places than the geological maps, the present map is in our view, more accurate in locating some stream and stream-lake connections. Definitive mapping of streams on Macquarie Island is yet to be done.
CATEGORIES AND THEIR TERMINOLOGY
Vegetation mapping categories were chosen to indicate foliage density and foliage height, similar to the scheme of Specht (Specht et al 1995), now widely adopted throughout Australia when mapping vegetation structure (AUSLIG 1990). It is appropriate to adopt Specht's boundary of 70% foliage projective cover of the ground in order to establish two categories, closed vegetation (foliage projective cover greater than 70%) and open vegetation (foliage projective cover less than 70%). Field checking showed that the SPOT imagery (22 December 1994) is a valuable aid in delineating boundaries between closed and open vegetation. Vegetation whose foliage stands higher than 0.4 to 0.5m above the ground is designated tall vegetation and it can be distinguished from short vegetation whose foliage is less than 0.4 to 0.5m in height.
The term herb is applied to vegetation containing herbaceous , i.e. essentially non-woody, species which includes monocotyledons (such as grasses and graminoids), dicotyledons (such as forbs), and ferns. The terms grass and grassland are not used, first because forbs and graminoids (such as sedges that are not in the grass family) are abundant in almost all areas of short herb vegetation, and second because in places where the tall tussock grass Poa foliosa is dominant it often forms complex mosaics with the large forb Stilbocarpa polaris so that this vegetation is categorised as closed tall herb vegetation, rather than tussock grassland.
 
The general term mire is applied to vegetation of waterlogged areas, in preference to the more restrictive terms bog or fen whose correct usage depends upon knowing attributes such as pH.
Each mapping unit identifies areas which, when examined at greater resolution, prove to be complex mosaics, some features of which are described below.
Vegetation cover 70% or greater (closed vegetation).
Closed tall herb vegetation, northern and eastern coast. The tall herbs are mainly the tussock grass Poa foliosa and the forb Stilbocarpa polaris but in restricted areas in valleys draining into Sandy Bay and Green Gorge, thickets of the fern Polystichum vestitum also occur. Poa foliosa and S. polaris may occur in almost monospecific stands, but they commonly occur together. The tall vegetation is absent on gentler slopes near the coast where drainage is poor, and on unstable surfaces such as active scree, outwash fans, and crumbling rocky outcrops. Closed tall herb vegetation also occurs on the western and southern steep coast-facing slopes below the plateau, but there it is included in the category 'vegetation on western and southern coast-facing slopes'. The category 'closed tall herb vegetation' covers Taylor's (1955) wet tussock grassland formation.
Closed short herb vegetation. This vegetation, commonly about 0.2m tall, provides near-complete or complete ground cover over large areas of the island, particularly on the plateau and in valleys that slope gently down towards the coast. This category, which can enclose small mires, also occurs on the eastern coast-facing slopes, particularly below the change of slope noted on the map. The floristic (species) composition is complex. It ranges from extensive stands of Acaena spp. that are almost monospecific to communities made up of most of the vascular species of the island. Sedge-like plants such as Luzula crinita are abundantly and widely distributed in this vegetation category.
Bryophytes make an important contribution to the total ground cover. The category 'closed short herb vegetation' includes most of Taylor's (1955) sub-glacial herbfield formation.
Closed vegetation on western and northern marine-cut platform. A wide gently sloping wave-cut platform fringes the northern and part of the western coast of the island. It is backed by steep slopes leading up to the plateau and is mantled by a complex mosaic of tall and short herb closed vegetation, mires and lakes. Some areas are dominated by bryophytes. The platform's low slope, with abundant precipitation and drainage from the plateau has led to waterlogging in many parts. The category 'closed vegetation on western and northern marine-cut platform' includes parts of Taylor's (1955) sub-glacial herbfield formation, and parts of his bog and fen formations.
Mire on the plateau. Mire vegetation in permanently saturated areas and infilled lakes is short and covers the ground completely. Bryophytes are frequently dominant. Mires occur in valley bottoms where slope angle is low, but where groundwater emerges they occur on quite steep surfaces in very localised areas. The category 'mire on the plateau' includes parts of Taylor's (1955) bog and fen formations.
Vegetation cover less than 70% (open vegetation).
Open short herb vegetation (and northern and eastern gullies). The pattern and proportions of bare ground and vegetation are extremely variable. There is commonly a mosaic of polygonal patches in which both the bare ground and the edges of the vegetated areas are subject to erosion. Also common are alternating stripes of vegetation and bare ground, often in the form of stepped benches or terraces. Bryophytes become dominant or codominant with angiosperms such as Azorella macquariensis in the most exposed places. This category includes the feldmark formation of Taylor (1955), and the sparse vegetation on unfavourable soils (Adamson et al 1993).
Vegetation on western and southern coast-facing slopes. This is a complex interdigitation of tall, short, closed and open vegetation with bluffs, cliffs and large active screes along the steep slopes below the plateau along the western and southern sides of the island. The mixture has been grouped as a complex rather than attempt its subdivision at this stage.
Vegetation cover c.0% (bare ground).
Large areas of bare ground devoid of bryophytes and vascular plants occur where penguins establish colonies, and where erosion is particularly active.

The intent was to avoid bias in the representation of habitats associated with differences in the extent and detail of surveys in different regions. The disadvantage of this approach, however, is that the more detailed surveys available or underway in some regions (Neale et al. 2007, WCMPF 2010, Benn 2009; Kettles &amp; Hughes 2009; Kerr 2010, Morrison et al. 2010) are not included in this broad scale analysis. These surveys should be included in more detailed regional assessments. The extent of habitat mapping was mainly defined by the Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) coastline, the LINZ boundary (2004) to the New Zealand Territorial Sea (within 12 nautical miles of the coast and islands), estuaries from the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) New Zealand Estuary Environment Classification (Hume 2007) and bioregions defined in the Marine Protected Areas Policy and Implementation Plan (Department of Conservation and Ministry of Fisheries 2005).Within these bioregions, spatial data layers for depth, substrata and exposure were overlaid in ArcGIS to approximate the habitat categories described in the Coastal Classification and Mapping Scheme (Appendix 1, Ministry of Fisheries and Department of Conservation 2008). In some cases, categories were modified according to what data were available and to provide consistent, justifiable, readily interpreted habitat descriptions that adequately reflect major patterns in marine environments. The data sources and habitat categories that were used are described in the report: Department of Conservation and Ministry of Fisheries(2012).&quot;Coastal marine habitats and marine protected areas in the New Zealand Territorial Sea: a broad scale gap analysis. Wellington, New Zealand. More detailed descriptions of source data within the New Zealand Territorial Sea are described in separate coverages for NZ marine bioregions; NZ depth, NZ substrata and NZ exposure. The GIS datasets were combined using the unioncommand in ArcGIS and ArcINFO 9.3. This command overlays and dissects the intersections between overlapping areas from different datasets. The function creates polygon features attributed with fields of variables from each of the source data sets. These fields were used to create composite categories derived from combinations of the different levels in the depth, substrata and exposure fields. The ArcGIS ‘eliminate’ command was used to minimise the large numbers of elongate ‘sliver polygons’ resulting from overlaying disparate datasets. Slivers less than 1 hectare in area were dissolved into the adjacent polygon with the longest joint boundary.Because of the number of small slivers and extent of the data set, boundaries between habitats classes were sometimes generalised resulting in small departures (usually &lt;50m) from the lines of the original habitat data including the coastline. Regard should then be given to the fitness for use of this data for use other than its intended purpose as a broad scale classification and gaps analysis. This should be taken into account particularly for viewing and analysis at fine spatial scales.In some cases, the source datasets did not completely overlap and for some areas a full classification using all environmental drivers was not possible. In most cases the area involved was small and polygons were merged with the nearest feature with the longest joint boundary. For parts of some estuaries, no nationally consistent data on substrata were available. These areas were mapped simply as unclassified estuary. This category was not however included within habitat counts for each bioregion.",New Zealand Department of Conservation,"New Zealand Department of Conservation (2021), MPA Policy Habitats of the Territorial Sea, available from: https://doc-marine-data-deptconservation.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/ab9d7519a4c94f57afc89ede9e72103e_0/about (accessed 14/03/2024)",2021,TRUE,Department of Conservation Geospatial Services Manager,NA,CC BY 3.0 NZ,https://creativecommons.org:80/licenses/by/3.0/nz,NA,https://doc-marine-data-deptconservation.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/ab9d7519a4c94f57afc89ede9e72103e_0/about,NA,NA,TRUE,Various,New Zealand,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

7,rbgk_madag_veg_2007,active,19/03/2024,Naema_GrosDubois,Atlas of the vegetation of madagascar,english,"The vegetation classification produced for this atlas includes 10 major physiognomic types (forest, woodland, bushland, thicket, grassland, anthropic and so on) and incorporates 15 mappable vegetation units.","Madagascar is home to more than 10 000 plant species, 80% of which occur nowhere else in the world. With natural vegetation ranging from rainforest to unique spiny forest, Madagascar’s range of plant diversity makes it one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots. In common with many other tropical countries, the flora of Madagascar is extremely threatened not only by habitat destruction for agriculture, fuelwood, building materials and so on, but also, in the case of certain species, by over-collection for the horticultural trade. The CEPF Madagascar Vegetation Mapping Project is a three-year project (2003–2006), funded by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) and managed jointly by The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Missouri Botanical Garden, and Conservation International’s Center for Applied Biodiversity Science. The project is innovative in a number of ways. It employs state-of-the art remote sensing technology and methodologies to delimit Madagascar’s vegetation. It represents an all-inclusive collaboration between specialists from a wide range of botanical and conservation institutions, which has ensured the most thoroughly ground-truthed vegetation map ever compiled for Madagascar. Finally, through a series of workshops, it incorporates detailed consultations with the conservation community to ensure that the final products are of maximum relevance and utility to conservation planners and managers. An accurate and updated vegetation map is imperative for conservation planning and natural resource management in Madagascar. It is also essential that the data on which such a map is based be made freely available, so that conservation organisations, government departments, academic institutions and other stakeholders can use them as an up-to-date standard dataset on which to base their activities. The electronic version of this atlas is available on Kew’s website (www.vegmad.org), and local experts were invited to continually improve and update the map. In order for a vegetation map to fulfil its intended role it must accurately delimit areas with various vegetation types as they currently exist, and assign those areas to objective categories that can be easily recognised in the field and that reliably reflect fundamental biological differences (primarily structural features, for example, physiognomy). Madagascar is becoming increasingly aware of the need to protect its biodiversity. The most immediate use of this vegetation map in conservation is likely to be by protected area managers who wish to understand the flora of their designated areas. It will also provide a valuable baseline for monitoring longer-term changes in vegetation inside and outside protected areas. However, Madagascar also provides an exceptionally high rate of species discovery and description, and this atlas will be used by field biologists attempting to identify potential sampling sites for biodiversity surveys, which will in turn yield data that is critical for biogeographic research and conservation planning. At the 2003 World Parks Congress, Madagascar’s President Marc Ravalomanana emphasised his country’s commitment to conservation by announcing its intent to triple the size of its existing protected area network. This admirable effort to prevent the extinction of many of Madagascar’s endemic species has become known as the ‘Durban Vision’. In order to ensure effective preservation of Madagascar’s biodiversity, the identification of sites for these new protected areas should follow a systematic process. A recent workshop on systematic conservation planning (November 2005, Antananarivo) highlighted the importance of using habitat types and indicators of habitat quality in addition to species distribution data when conducting conservation prioritisation analyses, concluding that this is the best way to produce robust conservation solutions. Because only a small proportion of Madagascar’s species have had their distributions documented, the vegetation types identified by this mapping project are good surrogates for habitat diversity and for the majority of the biota, which is so little known. In addition, conservation practitioners, including NGOs and donors, need information on trends in natural vegetation cover and quality in order to assess the outcomes of their conservation work. The Convention on Biological Diversity includes trends in the extent of habitats among its headline indicators for tracking progress towards the 2010 target (SBSTTA, 2004). The immediate focus of the Durban Vision group will be on establishing new protected areas (map 1) in remaining native vegetation, although subsequent attention could productively turn to managing that vegetation, and the habitat quality categories in the atlas provide valuable information. The atlas also provides important up-to-date information on native vegetation cover and quality, which maximises its potential to aid planning for future habitat restoration activities.",Royal Botanic Gardens Kew,"Moat, Justin & Smith, P..

8,des_qld_veg_2021,active,19/03/2024,Naema_GrosDubois,Remnant 2021 broad vegetation groups - Queensland,english,"The State of Queensland in northeast Australia covers 1.73 million square kilometres and encompasses a wide variety of landscapes across temperate, wet and dry tropics and semiarid to arid climatic zones. Currently (April 2023), 1435 regional ecosystems are recognised across Queensland. Regional ecosystems are defined and mapped at 1:100,000 scale across the state. Many regional ecosystems include one or more vegetation communities, some of which are only recognised and mapped at scales larger than 1:100,000. A vegetation community is an association within a regional ecosystem that has similar structure and floristics and occurs within the same land zone. Broad Vegetation Groups (BVGs) are a higher-level grouping of vegetation communities and regional ecosystems. 

BVGs provide an overview of vegetation across the state or a bioregion. They are a useful addition to the regional ecosystem framework by providing an overview of major ecological patterns and relationships across Queensland, independent of bioregions and land zones, and facilitate comparisons with vegetation in other states and internationally. The primary aim of this document is to concisely describe the BVGs of Queensland to enhance their use in government planning, policy and regulation, e.g., vegetation offsets, Bushfire Hazard Area mapping, public education and scientific investigations. Floristic, structural, functional, biogeographic and landscape attributes have all been used in the BVG classification. The first aggregation of BVGs in the hierarchical classification is determined on the basis of vegetation structure (cover, height and growth form) of the ecologically dominant layer. BVGs are ordered broadly to reflect the vegetation structure along a mesic gradient from wet closed forests (rainforests) of the coast and north east, to the arid spinifex hummock grasslands of the south west.","Specialised habitats such as freshwater wetlands (BVG 34) and intertidal areas (BVG 35) form the final groups. The rainforest aggregation (BVGs 1-7) is characterised by a generally closed tree canopy, predominantly non-sclerophyllous plants and frequently specialised lifeforms. The large aggregation of BVGs dominated by eucalypts (BVGs 8-19) is further subdivided on the basis of structure, mesic situation, landscape situation, predominant geology and dominant/ diagnostic species. The third aggregation of BVGs is dominated by trees or tall shrubs that are not eucalypts or rainforest species. Some BVGs in this aggregation are generally dominated by a single species, e.g., Melaleuca viridiflora (BVG 21a), or a group of taxonomically and functionally related species, e.g. Acacia cambagei/ A. georginae/ A. argyrodendron (BVG 26a), or by a combination of a structural formation, habitat and functionally related species such as low open woodlands on sand plains (BVG 27b). The final aggregation of BVGs is those not dominated by trees or tall shrubs. Some BVGs in this aggregation encompass vegetation types that are generally dominated by a suite of taxonomically and functionally related species, such as Acacia spp. on residuals (BVG 24a) or Senna spp. (e.g., BVG 24b). Other groups are dominated by a distinct structural formation (such as tussock and closed tussock grasslands BVGs 30-32). The Vegetation of Queensland describes the 98 BVGs defined for the 1:1M mapping level and lists the most extensive regional ecosystems in each BVG. The document is illustrated with 375 photographs, 108 tables and 103 maps, with detailed pre-clearing and remnant extent, and extent within the protected area estate. There are three nested levels of BVG which reflect the approximate scale at which they are designed to be used: the 1:1,000,000 (regional) (98 BVGs), 1:2,000,000 (state) (35 BVGs) and 1:5,000,000 (national) (16 BVGs).

9,aca_global_reef_2022,active,19/03/2024,Naema_GrosDubois,Allen Coral Atlas,english,"The Allen Coral Atlas is built by a dedicated team of scientists, technologists, and conservationists, using one-of-a-kind methodologies. The Allen Coral Atlas was conceived and funded by the late Paul Allen’s Vulcan Inc. and is managed by the Arizona State University Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science. Along with partners from Planet, the Coral Reef Alliance, and the University of Queensland, the Atlas utilizes high-resolution satellite imagery and advanced analytics to map and monitor the world’s coral reefs in unprecedented detail. The partnership together identified the following methods for habitat map creation, dynamic monitoring, and other related coral reef products. 

As part of the Allen Coral Atlas’s revisions to its habitat maps in 2022, a new reef extent product was generated for each mapping region. In context of this product, reef extent is defined as the location of shallow coral reef features that can generally be seen from satellites. It typically excludes areas of very deep and very turbid water. This is intended to provide a more generalized and inclusive layer that depicts the extent of the coral reef environment which is additional to the Atlas’ geomorphic zonation maps. The reef extent data product can be seen as a single layer on the Atlas and compared and analyzed alongside other datasets such as reef habitat maps and reef threat monitoring datasets. 

The underlying reef extent product is a raster at 5m pixel resolution, matching the geomorphic and benthic map products. The raster combines three sources:

1. The extent of the Allen Coral Atlas’s 12 geomorphic zones

2. The extent of our own machine learning-based coral reef habitat layer, originally developed for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network’s 2020 Report on the Status of Coral Reefs of the World

3. A third extent layer that: Filled in holes greater than 400 pixels (0.64Ha) and applied a morphological filter (circle kernel of 5 pixels; 25m) to smooth the reef boundaries and regain missing slope/beach features..

For the purposes of the data product made visible on the Allen Coral Atlas, these three sources are combined into one single-colored layer.

The reef extent layer more inclusively depicts the shallow coral reef environment than our more detailed benthic or geomorphic habitat maps. It includes reef features that were unmappable to geomorphic/benthic level, including deeper reef structures, reef habitat in more turbid water, deep or very steep reef slope areas, and very shallow intertidal areas at the land-sea interface. Known limitations are that some areas of supra-tidal beach and vegetation are included, which may not strictly be coral reef environments. Overall, the reef extent product is still conservative, and we expect that the area of reef erroneously included at the land-sea interface is greatly outweighed by the areas of reef still missed at both the shallow and deep margins of the product.","The six Allen Coral Atlas Global Benthic Habitat Map classes were developed by Roelfsema et al 2013* with input from other coral reef benthic classifications. This classification maximizes the breadth of information available from Planet Dove remote sensing data to create the best set of classes we can to support users. Benthic classification for global scale reef mapping is still constrained by spatial resolution, quality and accessibility of biophysical earth observation data. The satellites we use are still fundamentally unable to distinguish some of the key measures that ecologists prefer to assess reef health (e.g., cover of living coral, cover of dead coral, cover of bleached corals and functional forms of algae) but broad classes like Coral Habitat and Rubble can still be informative for characterising the local ecology.",Allen Coral Atlas Partnership; University of New South Wales; University of Queensland; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; Coral Reef Alliance; Arizona State University; National Geographic Society,"Allen Coral Atlas (2022).

This approach was applied between all image-date pairs producing 10 maps for each epoch, which were summarised to produce the global mangrove time-series. The resulting mangrove extent maps had an estimated accuracy of 87.4 % (95th conf. int.: 86.2 - 88.6 %), although the accuracies of the individual gain and loss change classes were lower at 58.1 % (52.4 - 63.9 %) and 60.6 % (56.1 - 64.8 %), respectively.

Mangroves have significantly reduced in global extent over the last 50 years, primarily as a result of deforestation caused by the expansion of agriculture and aquaculture in coastal environments. However, a limited number of studies have attempted to estimate changes in global mangrove extent, particularly into the 1990s, despite much of the loss in mangrove extent occurring pre-2000.

The GLIMS initiative has created a unique glacier inventory, storing information about the extent and rates of change of all the world's mountain glaciers and ice caps. The GLIMS Glacier Database was built up from data contributions from many glaciological institutions, which are managed by Regional Coordinators, who coordinate the production of glacier mapping results for their particular region. The GLIMS Glacier Database provides students, educators, scientists, and the public with reliable glacier data from these analyses. New glacier data are continually being added to the database. The GLIMS Glacier Viewer was developed to provide the public with easy access to the GLIMS Glacier Database. This Web application allows users to view and query several thematic layers, including glacier outlines, Regional Coordinator institution locations, the World Glacier Inventory, and more.

To better understand the global distribution and changes in tidal marsh extent, and identify opportunities for their conservation and restoration, it is critical to develop a spatial knowledge base of their global occurrence. 

Here, we develop a globally consistent tidal marsh distribution map for the year 2020 at 10-m resolution. To map the location of the world’s tidal marshes we applied a random forest classification model to earth observation data from the year 2020. We trained the classification model with a reference dataset developed to support distribution mapping of coastal ecosystems, and predicted the spatial distribution of tidal marshes between 60°N to 60°S. We validated the tidal marsh map using standard accuracy assessment methods, with our final map having an overall accuracy score of 0.852. We estimate the global extent of tidal marshes in 2020 to be 52,880 km2 (95% CI: 32,030 to 59,780 km2) distributed across 120 countries and territories. Tidal marsh distribution is centred in temperate and Arctic regions, with nearly half of the global extent of tidal marshes occurring in the temperate Northern Atlantic (45%) region. At the national scale, over a third of the global extent (18,510 km2; CI: 11,200 – 20,900) occurs within the USA. Our analysis provides the most detailed spatial data on global tidal marsh distribution to date and shows that tidal marshes occur in more countries and across a greater proportion of the world’s coastline than previous mapping studies. Our map fills a major knowledge gap regarding the distribution of the world’s coastal ecosystems and provides the baseline needed for measuring changes in tidal marsh extent and estimating their value in terms of ecosystem services.","Tidal marsh ecosystems are heavily impacted by human activities, highlighting apressing need to address gaps in our knowledge of their distribution.

The year 2020 corresponds to the cut-off date of the Regulation from the European Union ""on the making available on the Union market and the export from the Union of certain commodities and products associated with deforestation and forest degradation"" (EUDR, Regulation (EU) 2023/1115). In the context of the EUDR, the global forest cover map can be used as a non-mandatory, non-exclusive, and not legally binding source of information. Further information about the map and its use can be found on the EU Observatory on Deforestation and Forest Degradation (EUFO) in the section on Frequently Asked Questions.

Forest means land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10%, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ, excluding land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Agricultural use means the use of land for the purpose of agriculture, including for agricultural plantations (i.e. tree stands in agricultural production systems such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems) and set- aside agricultural areas, and for rearing livestock. All plantations of relevant commodities other than wood, that is cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soya, are excluded from the forest definition. The global map of forest cover was created by combining available global datasets (wall-to-wall or global in their scope) on tree cover, tree height, land cover and land use into a single harmonized globally-consistent representation of where forests existed in 2020.","The workflow consisted in first mapping the global maximum extent of tree cover circa the year 2020 from the combination of ESA World Cover 2020 and 2021, WRI Tropical Tree Cover 2020, UMD Global land cover and land use 2019, Global Mangrove Watch 2020, and JRC Tropical Moist Forest 2020 datasets. In the second step, a series of overlays and decision rules were applied to reduce this maximum extent of tree cover and align it with the Forest definition using datasets covering cropland and commodity expansion (ESA World Cereal, UMD Global land cover and land use 2019, UMD Global Cropland Expansion, High-resolution global map of smallholder and industrial oil palm plantations, and WRI Spatial Database of Planted Trees), land use change (UMD global forest cover loss, JRC Tropical Moist Forest, IIASA Global Forest Management), built-up (JRC Global Human Settlement), and water (JRC Global Surface Water).

Data were compiled for 82 countries around the world, with most country maps originating from supervised classification or manual polygon delineation of Landsat, SPOT or RapidEye satellite imagery.

The category of “planted trees” in the SDPT includes forest plantations of native or introduced species, established through deliberate human planting or seeding. Sometimes called “tree farms,” these forests infuse the global economy with a constant stream of lumber for construction, pulp for paper and fuelwood for energy. The data set also includes agricultural tree crops like oil palm plantations, avocado farms, apple orchards and even Christmas tree farms. The SDPT makes it possible to identify planted forests and tree crops as being separate from natural forests and enables changes in these planted areas to be monitored independently from changes in global natural forest cover.

The SDPT contains 173 million hectares of planted forest and 50 million hectares of agricultural trees, or approximately 82% of the world’s total planted forest area in 2015 (FAO 2015). The SDPT was compiled through a procedure that included cleaning and processing each individual data set before creating a harmonized attribute table.

Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.

Given the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily Landsat, supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.

Each polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A “gr” in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:* Large industrial plantation: single plantation units larger than 100 hectares* Mosaic of medium-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use* Mosaic of small-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.* Clearing/ very young plantation: bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc)For more information on this data set and how it was produced, see the forthcoming WRI Technical Note associated with this project.",NA,Transparent World; Global Forest Watch,"Transparent World (2016) Tree plantations [dataset], Accessed through Global Forest Watch on [28/03/2024]. www.globalforestwatch.org",2016,TRUE,Global Forest Watch,https://www.globalforestwatch.org/help/,CC BY 4.0 DEED,https://creativecommons.org/licences/by/4.0/,NA,https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/gfw::tree-plantations/explore,NA,NA,TRUE,T7.3,Regional,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When overlayed with other global or local climate and socio-economic data, the dataset can be used to evaluate the social and ecological benefits and costs from plantations, such as the carbon sequestration from planted forests. Because this dataset contains information on the tree species, it can also help with the prediction of yield from tree crops and the demand for water. Our code to map planting years can be reused on other similar plantation datasets, such as a new version of the SDPT, which may be released in the future. However, parameter settings for LandTrendr in this study were determined based on the previous research and the testing results for NBR time series of the plantations. When applying this method to other vegetation restoration detections, such as the natural restoration of forests, these parameters may need to be adjusted.

The ""startyear"" band should be used as the Quality Assessment (QA) band for this dataset because the supplementary value from 1982 to the start year may contain erroneous LandTrendr estimates of planting years.

The values of the three bands range from 1981 to 2019, 0 to 2020 and 1 to 190, respectively. For the ""plantyear"" band, a value of 1981 means the planting year was before 1982, and values from 1982 to 2019 correspond to the planting years.

Ice transforms the hydrologic, ecologic, climatic and socio-economic functions of river corridors. Although river ice extent has been shown to be declining in many regions of the world, the seasonality, historical change and predicted future changes in river ice extent and duration have not yet been quantified globally. Previous studies of river ice, which suggested that declines in extent and duration could be attributed to warming temperatures were based on data from sparse locations. Furthermore, existing projections of future ice extent are based solely on the location of the 0-°C isotherm. Here, using satellite observations, we show that the global extent of river ice is declining, and we project a mean decrease in seasonal ice duration of 6.10 ± 0.08 days per 1-°C increase in global mean surface air temperature. We tracked the extent of river ice using over 400,000 clear-sky Landsat images spanning 1984–2018 and observed a mean decline of 2.5 percentage points globally in the past three decades. To project future changes in river ice extent, we developed an observationally calibrated and validated model, based on temperature and season, which reduced the mean bias by 87 per cent compared with the 0-degree-Celsius isotherm approach. We applied this model to future climate projections for 2080–2100: compared with 2009–2029, the average river ice duration declines by 16.7 days under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, whereas under RCP 4.5 it declines on average by 7.3 days.

31,mapb_brazil_lcov_2022,active,09/04/2024,Naema_GrosDubois,MapBiomas Brasil,portuguese; english,"In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89% ranging from 73 to 95% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.","It all starts with images from the Landsat satellite, with a resolution of 30 meters, available free of charge on the Google Earth Engine platform and with a time series of more than 30 years. It takes 380 Landsat images to cover Brazil, each one with tens of millions of pixels: in total, there are more than 9 billion pixels measuring 30 x 30 meters to cover the entire country. These pixels are the working units of MapBiomas. Images may contain clouds, smoke and other artifacts that can “dirty” them. To produce a clean image, cloud-free pixels are selected from the images available for the selected period. For each of these pixels, metrics are extracted that explain the behavior of the pixel in that year. This is done for each of the satellite's 7 spectral bands as well as for the calculated fractions and spectral indices. For example, for Band 1, the median of the band values ​​in the period, the maximum value, the minimum value and the range of variation are collected. In the end, each pixel carries up to 105 layers of information for a year.

For each year, a mosaic is created that covers Brazil, representing the behavior of each pixel through 105 metrics or layers of information. This set of tiles is saved as an Asset within the Google Earth Engine platform. These mosaics will be used in two main ways. First as a source of parameters for the algorithm to classify the images (see next step). It is also from this mosaic that the RGB composition comes out that allows you to view the background image on the MapBiomas platform. This composition is also used for collecting training samples and evaluating accuracy by visual interpretation.

From the image mosaics, the teams from each biome and each transversal theme produce a map of each class of land cover and use (forest, countryside, agriculture, pasture, urban area, water, etc.). To do this, MapBiomas analysts use an automatic classifier called “random forest”, which runs on Google's processor cloud. This system is based on machine learning: for each topic to be classified, the machines are “trained” with samples of the targets to be classified. These samples are obtained through reference maps, generation of stable class maps from previous MapBiomas series and direct collection through visual interpretation of Landsat images. The classification is made for each year of the series, and can be saved as a single map per class where each pixel has a number of layers corresponding to the number of years in the historical series analyzed.

The spatial filter aims to increase the spatial consistency of the data, eliminating isolated or edge pixels. Neighborhood rules are defined that can lead to changes in the pixel classification. For example, a pixel that has less than two of its nine neighboring pixels in the same class will be reclassified to the predominant class in the neighborhood. Each pixel in each year and for each use class goes through this spatial filtering process.

To reduce temporal inconsistencies, in particular impossible or not permitted changes in coverage and use (e.g. Natural Forest > Non-Forest > Natural Forest) and correct failures due to excess cloud or lack of data, temporal filter rules are applied. For each biome, theme or region, there may be specific temporal filter rules. In total, in Collection 8, more than a hundred rules were applied. The temporal filter is applied to each pixel analyzing all years of the Collection (e.g. Collection 8 was 38 years).

At this stage, the maps of each class are integrated into a single map, which represents the coverage and land use of the entire territory for each year. Prevalence rules are applied: thus, if the same pixel is classified into two maps of different classes, it is possible to define which one it belongs to in the final map. Prevalence rules may vary according to the peculiarities of biomes, themes or regions. The integration is done for each year of the series and generates an integrated map for each year, generally saved as a single ASSET with the number of annual layers for the analyzed period. The integrated map goes through another spatial filtering step to clean up edges and loose pixels as a result of the integration process.

To understand changes in land cover and use, maps are produced with class transitions between different pairs of selected years. This way it is possible to visualize the dynamism of the territory, and answer questions such as how much of the forest became pasture from one year to the next, for example, among other changes in the landscape. Transition maps are produced pixel by pixel and, once finalized, they also go through a spatial filter to eliminate isolated transition or edge pixels. From these maps, transition matrices are constructed for each biome, state, municipality and other territorial sections available on the MapBiomas platform.",MapBiomas Brasil,"MapBiomas Project – Collection 8 of the Annual Series of Coverage and Land Use Maps of Brazil, accessed on 09/04/2024 via the link: https://brasil.mapbiomas.org/en/colecoes-mapbiomas/",2022,TRUE,MapBiomas,contato@mapbiomas.org,CC-BY-SA,https://creativecommons.org/licences/by-sa/4.0/; https://brasil.mapbiomas.org/termos-de-uso/,NA,https://brasil.mapbiomas.org/en/colecoes-mapbiomas/,https://doi.org/10.58053/MapBiomas/VJIJCL,NA,TRUE,Various,Brazil,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The naming and initial classification hierarchy was based on a strict vegetation classification.

The ecosystem map was therefore based on the vegetation classes, and when cross-walked with the IUCN Typology, resulted in 162 ecosystems, which resulted in 6 realms (level 1), 8 biomes (level 2), 15 functional ecosystem types (level 3), 32 regional ecosystems (level 4), and 162 ecosystems (level 5).

For the purposes of the Global Ecosystems Atlas, anthropogenic areas obtained from the Mozambique land cover map were overlayed and masked out so that the map can represent current extent.","Principles informing the development of the vegetation map The first step was to define the general principles to be followed to develop the new ecosystem map:
• Establish a working group of national and international experts who could support the development of the map;
• Build on the strengths of existing vegetation maps, such as Wild & Barbosa (1967) and Pedro & Barbosa (1955), by maintaining those vegetation unit concepts that are supported by more recent field information;
• Build on the field knowledge and experience of the authors of the recently published book on the trees of Mozambique, and regional and national specialists, in splitting, merging or creating new ecosystem units;
• Endeavour to map the historical extent of vegetation types as best as possible so as to be able assess loss of ecosystems. To do so the authors considered the historic vegetation maps as well as the earliest suitable Landsat 1-3 imagery (1972-1983);
• Consider edge-matching with adjacent and more recent vegetation maps from surrounding countries to create a more cohesive vegetation map for the broader region
• To map at a scale of 1: 250 000 or finer so that resulting ecosystems can be used in fine-scaled conservation planning and offset projects;
• Utilise existing species datasets by collating all available georeferenced plant species distribution records to infer or visualise local vegetation communities in poorly-known areas;
• Utilise new GIS technologies, such as Random Forest, and available GIS datasets to classify poorly known areas;
• Validate the resulting map and vegetation unit names by national specialists through a process of comments, workshops and meetings;
• Update the map and vegetation unit names. Phase 1: Supervised classification of expert identified vegetation units.

In seventh assessment interpretation has been done digitally for thirteen states namely; Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Delhi (UT), Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, which comprises 63% of the forest cover of the country. By eighth assessment the entire country was covered by digital assessment.

The forest cover is broadly classified in 4 classes, namely very dense forest, moderately dense forest, open forest and mangrove. The classification of the cover into dense and open forests is based on internationally adopted norms of classification.

The LULC maps are generated using multi-temporal satellite data of IRS AWiFS sensor for year 2017-18.

The data was classified following a hybrid approach (Decision Tree - See5 or Supervised MXL or both). The selection of a classifier is dependent on the number of temporal datasets available during the season, freedom from cloud/haze, complexity of the terrain and temporal registration errors etc., The classification procedure followed is as per the guidelines given in LULC manual. In North Eastern states, Jammu & Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka the required temporal registration was found to be a limiting factor due to complexity of the terrain. In these states the cropped areas were extracted using the individual months and combined with the other LULC information.

The accuracy was assessed at state level (India administrative unit).Stratified random points generated were used to assess the accuracy of classification. The number of sample points for each strata for selected based on the proportion of the area. However, a minimum of 20 sample points were considered for each class to estimate the accuracy of the classified output.

Land Cover classes can include natural features such as tropical forest, shrubland, grassland, water bodies, and bare land, but also human-made features such as asphalt cover and cropland. Nineteen land cover classes were defined, using the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) standard developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.","The 2020 North American Land Cover 30-meter dataset was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between Natural Resources Canada, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad), and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries.

The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each country’s specific requirements.  

This 30-meter dataset of North American Land Cover reflects land cover information for 2020 from Mexico and Canada, 2019 over the conterminous United States and 2021 over Alaska. Each country developed its own classification method to identify Land Cover classes and then provided an input layer to produce a continental Land Cover map across North America. Canada, Mexico, and the United States developed their own 30-meter land cover products; see specific sections on data generation below.

The main inputs for image classification were 30-meter Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 1 data in the three countries (Canada, the United States and Mexico). Image selection processes and reduction to specific spectral bands varied among the countries due to study-site-specific requirements. While Canada selected most images from the year 2020 with a few from 2019 and 2021, the Conterminous United States employed mainly images from 2019, while Alaska land cover maps are mainly based on the use of images from 2021. The land cover map for Mexico was based on land cover change detection between 2015 and 2020 Mexico Landsat 8 mosaics.

In order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North America, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by CONABIO, INEGI, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS. Each country chose their own approaches, ancillary data, and land cover mapping methodologies to create national datasets. This North America dataset was produced by combining the national land cover datasets. The integration of the three national products merged four 
Land Cover map sections, Alaska, Canada, the conterminous United States and Mexico.

Purpose:
Information on land cover across North America provided by this dataset is valuable for a range of audiences, including international organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme, nongovernmental conservation organizations, land managers, and scientific researchers. The continental scale land cover data generated under NALCMS can be used to address issues such as climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity loss, and changes in ecosystem structure and function, by helping users to better understand the dynamics and continental-scale patterns of North America’s changing environment.

The North American Environmental Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These 30-meter land cover data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:100,000-scale data.

All the characteristics are considered when determining ecoregions, but the relative importance of each characteristic may vary from one ecoregion to another. 

Different levels of ecological regions are identified with a Roman numeral hierarchical scheme. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 broad ecological regions.

52,nca_czech_eco_2010,active,22/04/2024,Naema_GrosDubois,Katalog biotopů České republiky Ed. 2.,czech,"Distribution maps summarize occurrence of habitat types in grid cells of 5 minutes of longitude × 3 minutes of latitude, i.e. approximately 6 × 5.5 km. However, the grid drawn on the maps has a cell size of 10 × 6 minutes and each of its cells includes four nested cells containing habitat occurrence data. The maps show the distribution of habitat types as recorded during fi eld mapping in 2001–2008, with some additions based on relevés from the Czech National Phytosociological Database recorded in the field in the period of 1991–2009.","This book acts as a manual that defines units used for habitat mapping in the Czech Republic. The system of Czech habitat types is compatible with those delimited in Annex I of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), a European Union legal instrument for the development of Natura 2000, a network of Special Areas of Conservation whose purpose is the protection of European natural habitats, wild fauna and flora. However, unlike the Annex I list, which includes only selected habitats of high conservation value, the Czech system of habitat classification is comprehensive: it contains all major habitat types occurring in the country and enables assignment of any site in the fi eld to a particular habitat type. In some cases, the delimitations of habitat types within Natura 2000 do not reflect actual patterns of variation observed in the Czech Republic and in fact contrast sharply with traditional systems of vegetation classification used in this country. Therefore, the habitat classification presented in this Catalogue has been developed as a compromise between the Natura 2000 system and adequate description of Czech habitat types. It is appropriate for description and management of Czech natural habitats, while remaining unequivocally transferable into the classification used in Natura 2000. 

The first edition of the Habitat Catalogue was published in 2001. After its publication, an extensive habitat mapping programme was carried out in the Czech Republic, organised by the Agency of Nature Conservation and Landscape Protection of the Czech Republic and involving a few hundred fi eld workers. Baseline mapping took place in 2001–2004 and since 2006 data have been regularly updated, with effectively one twelfth of the Czech territory re-mapped every year. A parallel project of habitat monitoring based on permanent plots began in 2008. Field mapping has significantly improved our knowledge of the distribution and conservation status of particular habitats in the country. In addition, the system of phytosociological classification of Czech vegetation has been extensively revised since the publication of the first edition of the Habitat Catalogue, based on the analysis of the Czech National Phytosociological Database. The second edition of the Habitat Catalogue reflects this progress, as well as changes in the delimitation of habitat types at the European level. It contains entirely new distribution maps of habitat types based on the results of field mapping, estimations of the total area of each habitat in the country, revised lists of typical species of each habitat, more detailed comments regarding threats and conservation management, updated correspondence between habitat types of the Czech Republic and those defined in Annex I of the Habitats Directive and in the EUNIS system, and updated lists of references. 

The basic division of the Habitat Catalogue is into nine groups of habitats, including: 
V Streams and water bodies 
M Wetlands and riverine vegetation 
R Springs and mires 
S Cliffs and boulder screes
 A Alpine treeless habitats 
T Secondary grasslands and heathlands 
K Scrub 
L Forests 
X Habitats strongly influenced or created by man 

Within each group, habitats are subdivided into units (codes such as T8) and subunits (codes such as T8.2). There are a total of 140 subunits and undivided units. For the sake of compatibility with Natura 2000 and some other systems of habitat classification (e.g. the Emerald system), additional subunits at the lowest hierarchical level are used in some cases, with codes such as T8.2A. Habitats of group X are described only briefly, as they are not the focus of nature conservation. They are, however, necessary for comprehensive site description. For the sake of continuity, the delimitation of Czech habitat types and their codes remain the same as in the first edition of the Habitat Catalogue, except the merging of habitats X10 and X11, and changes in some subunits at the lowest hierarchical level.",Agentura Ochrany Přírody A Krajiny České Republiky (Nature Conservation Agency of the Czech Republic); Masaryk University,"Chytrý M., Kučera T., Kočí M., Grulich V. & Lustyk P.

60,usda_antilles_lcov_2023,active,07/05/2024,Naema_GrosDubois,"St. Kitts, Nevis, St. Eustatius, Grenada, and Barbados land cover and forest formations (1999-2003)",english,"This data publication contains six raster datasets detailing the land cover and forest structure of several Caribbean islands. These include the islands of St. Kitts, Nevis, St. Eustatius, Grenada and Barbados. Each dataset represents land-cover and woody vegetation formations and is provided as an ERDAS IMAGINE georeferenced raster file and as a GeoTIFF raster file. Spatial land cover datasets for Barbados were created using Landsat ETM+ imagery from 2001 and 2002. Grenada datasets were created using Landsat ETM+ imagery from 2000 and 2001 and Landsat 5 TM imagery from 1986. Lastly, spatial land cover datasets for St. Kitts, Nevis, and St. Eustatius were created using Landsat ETM+ imagery dated between 1999 and 2003.","For the map of St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Eustatius and the map of Grenada, we used decision tree software to classify Landsat image mosaics over the two study areas. In the classifications, we combined ancillary raster data, like topographic variables, with the Landsat image bands. The Landsat imagery included one image mosaic and one image for Grenada, and two image mosaics for the St. Kitts study area. The image mosaics were developed by applying regression trees to normalize images from other dates to fill the cloudy areas present in the base scene for each mosaic. We then assessed accuracy of the Landsat image classifications with 1-meter (m) pan-sharpened, false color IKONOS imagery dated from 2000-2003. For a few remaining cloudy areas, we manually interpreted forest formations and land cover from the IKONOS imagery.

For the map of Barbados, we first mapped forest formations and land cover by manually interpreting 1-m pan-sharpened, true color IKONOS imagery, circa 2000. Much of Barbados was cloud-obscured in all available Landsat imagery. Also, because we did not have multiseason imagery for Barbados, some forest formations were generalized. Secondly, we quantified the extents of protected forest by formation for all five of the islands. For Grenada, Barbados and St. Eustatius, we used a protected area database for the insular Caribbean produced by The Nature Conservancy. The primary source for protected areas was the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA-Consortium 2003), which was enhanced using country-scale protected area information (TNC 2007). All the Barbados protected areas in the database are only informally protected. A 1000-ft contour provided boundaries for protected lands on Nevis, because development is prohibited above that elevation. Boundaries for the new central forest reserve on St. Kitts, which include most lands above 1000 ft elevation, came from the St. Kitts Physical Planning Division. We manually digitized boundaries for Brimstone Hill National Park, in St. Kitts.

As in Helmer et al. (2002), the forest and shrubland classes are designated to the formation level. Formations are adapted from Areces-Malea et al. (1999), who classify Caribbean vegetation according to standards of the U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC 1997). To avoid confusion with some FGDC standards, we use only the term semi-deciduous (after Areces-Mallea et al. 1999), and we use it for stands with 25 to 75% of deciduous woody canopy species. Mixed refers to mixed ever-green and deciduous cover that includes trees or shrubs at maturity, as in Areces-Malea et al. (1999). At least 75% of seasonal evergreen and evergreen canopy species are evergreen.

Forest includes lands with at least 25% tree or tree plus shrub cover, combining the two forest successional stages of Helmer et al. (2002). The one case in which we distinguish the younger forest/shrub class is where young stands are drought deciduous but adjacent older forest is semi-deciduous (forest/shrub includes lands with 25-60% tree plus shrub cover, or ≥60% cover of uniformly young seedlings or saplings that may include shrubs). As in Helmer et al. (2002), we reserve the term woodland for lands with >25% canopy cover of drought deciduous shrubs or trees. In the map legends we generalized the driest coastal forest and shrubland formations into one class. With the exception of large patches of Coccoloba uvifera on St. Kitts, most patches of coastal evergreen forest were too small to be distinct from the matrix of drought deciduous and mixed formations. In addition, in Barbados, the class deciduous, evergreen coastal and mixed forest or shrubland (with or without succulents), also includes a mosaic of drought deciduous, semi-deciduous and seasonal evergreen forest/shrub below and to the northeast of Mt. Hillaby.

We used a regression tree method (Helmer and Ruefenacht 2005) to make nearly cloud-free image mosaics. Details on the method are available in Helmer and Ruefenacht (2005). Most of the Landsat scenes were terrain-corrected, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images. We also used two ETM+ images over the St. Kitts area and one Landsat 5 image over Grenada that were not terrain-corrected. All images were co-registered, to within <1 pixel root mean square error, to the clearest terrain-corrected image for each study area.

We made two image mosaics for the St. Kitts study area (Helmer and Ruefenacht 2007), including one mosaic for each of two stages of phenology for drought deciduous woody vegetation. Drought deciduous woody vegetation was “leaf-on” in the base scene for the mosaic from the be-ginning of the dry season. Drought deciduous woody vegetation was in a “leaf-off” state in the base image for the other. For Grenada, we made one image mosaic and used a Landsat 5 scene as a leaf-off image in the classification.

We evaluated whether the decision tree software See5 (http://www.rulequest .com) could effectively classify cloud-cleared Landsat imagery 1) in Grenada, and 2) for a more detailed set of classes than previous work in the St. Kitts study area. Reference, or training data for each classification consisted of 25 to >100 multipixel patches distributed throughout the extent of each class, resulting in a dense training dataset of thousands of pixels per class. The data included field-based data for St. Kitts, Nevis, and Grenada that was collected between January and June 2003. Field data collection relied on simultaneously observing land cover and forest formation both in satellite imagery and in the field. In the field we integrated a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with a laptop computer (with a daylight-viewable image display) running the ERDAS Imagine GPS tool (Leica-Geosystems 2003).

To distribute training data throughout the extent of each class, we then supplemented these field data by visually interpreting pan-sharpened, 1-m false color or true color IKONOS images. The IKONOS imagery was from the years 2000-2001 for St. Kitts and Nevis, and from 2003 for Grenada. The images were dated between October and February, when drought deciduous woody vegetation was in a leaf-on stage. Field work in St. Kitts and Nevis included traversing eight elevation gradients on windward and leeward sides of these islands. This extensive training data allowed us to estimate the elevations where seasonal evergreen forest changed to ever-green forest for different windward and leeward slopes, even though these two forest types were not visually distinct in the IKONOS imagery. The training data for sugar cane included subclasses that differed by field maturity. Most drought deciduous vegetation was in a leaf-off stage in the leaf-off image mosaic; however, we also included a separate training class for some patches of drought deciduous woodlands that were greened up in the leaf-off imagery. The training data also initially combined the signatures for large patches of coastal evergreen forest or shrubland in St. Kitts with seasonal evergreen forest for later editing. Spectral signatures for all barren lands were also combined, and barren lands were later manually separated into different classes (e.g. quarry, sand, bare ground) after decision tree classification. In mountainous areas, we collected a shadowed and sunlit version of each class (Helmer et al. 2000). In Grenada, training data for herbaceous agriculture were joined with training data for pasture, and herbaceous agriculture was manually recoded from pasture.

Ancillary data were combined with satellite imagery to create an island-wide predictor variable datasets for image classification. Topographic variables, derived from Shuttle Radar Topography mission digital elevation data (Farr and Kobrick 2000) included elevation, slope, slope position, aspect, and topographic shading based on the sun elevation and azimuth of each image date (or reference image date in the case of image mosaics). Vector derived variables included distance to roads, distance to coast, and distance to ravine. Finally, band indices and ratios were created from the Landsat image bands to produce the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 4/5 band ratio. The ancillary predictor data were spatially co-registered to and stacked with Landsat image bands 1–5, 7, and two-band indices to create a multi-band image for each image mosaic. For the St. Kitts study area, we also included variance over 3x3 windows of the 15-m pan band from the leaf-on image mosaic that we then resampled to a 30-m cell size.

The locations of each pixel in the training data were used to extract corresponding values of the image bands and ancillary data from the stack of raster data for each classification. These data were then input into the See5 software to create a classification model which we then applied to classify the raster data stack. We used the default values in See5 for classification with pruning. We also included the boosting option with 10 trials; each trial results in a new tree. Finally, we applied larger misclassification costs for the most common misclassifications from initial runs of the program. The classification model was then applied to the stack of raster data with the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) tool for ERDAS Imagine (Leica-Geosystems 2003) from the U.S. Geological Survey (ftp://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/edcuser/dewitz/NLCD_mapping_tool).

For the study areas that underwent decision tree classification, stratified random samples, of about 50 pixels per class, provided data for estimating classification accuracies. The accuracy assessments excluded classes or areas that were entirely visually-interpreted: forested and non-forested wetlands in the St. Kitts study area, herbaceous agriculture in Grenada and the remaining cloudy areas. Barren classes were also combined for the assessment. We differentiated the barren pixels by visual “heads-up” digitization over the IKONOS imagery. With evergreen and seasonal evergreen forest formations not being distinct in the IKONOS imagery, we combined them in the accuracy assessment. An error matrix was produced for each mapped class that estimates the overall percentage of correctly classified pixels, producer and user's accuracies, and the kappa coefficient.

Because forest formations and land cover for Barbados were for the most part manually delineated, we did not perform an accuracy assessment for that map. Very fine resolution imagery was not available for St. Eustatius at the time of the accuracy assessment. However, we verified and manually edited the classification for St. Eustatius based on the high resolution imagery that is now viewable on Google Earth (http://earth.google.com/).

This raster dataset differentiates cloud forest into two classes and was created from previously published Landsat satellite image mosaics dated 1991 and 2000 for Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra. Also included is a land cover map showing the distributions of land cover and forest formations for Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra that do not differentiate cloud forest into two classes. Two images are also provided that show the land cover and forest formations that 1) do differentiate cloud forest into two classes and 2) do not differentiate cloud forest into two classes.","We assembled a time series of maps for Puerto Rico for the years 1951, 1977, 1991, and 2000, which included land cover maps based on aerial photo interpretation for 1951 and 1977, maps of forest type and land cover in 1991 and 2000 based on Landsat satellite imagery, and a map of land development from 1991 to 2000 (Helmer and Ruefenacht, 2005). The satellite image–based maps for 1991–1992 and 2000 came from separately classifying two Landsat image mosaics; one mosaic was from imagery dated around the years 1991–1992, and one was from imagery dated around the year 2000. The image mosaics used the regression tree method of Helmer and Ruefenacht (2005) to fill cloudy areas in Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery from other image dates, and they were the same two mosaics developed in that study.

Ancillary data were combined with satellite imagery to create an island-wide predictor variable dataset for image classification. Topographic variables, derived from USGS 30 meter (m) digital elevation models (DEM) included elevation, slope, aspect, and topographic shadow. Climatic variables included annual precipitation, mean temperature, and potential evapotranspiration-to-precipitation ratio. Vector derived variables included distance to roads, road density, and geology. Finally, band indices and ratios were created from the Landsat image bands to produce the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 4/5 band ratio. The ancillary predictor data were spatially co-registered to and stacked with Landsat image bands 1–5, 7, and two-band indices to create a multi-band image for each image mosaic.

Island-wide reconnaissance surveys in 1999–2000 and 2003, including airborne reconnaissance in 2003, were performed to collect training and reference data. The island wide field surveys and expert consultation with regional vegetation experts enabled us discern land cover and forest type on 1:33,000-scale color infrared aerial photos dated 1991 and 1:38,000-scale color photos dated 1999. Land cover and forest type interpreted in aerial photos and field surveys were then identified in the satellite imagery and used to create classification training data.

To classify the Landsat image mosaics for 1991–1992 and 2000 into forest types and land cover, we completed a supervised classification based on classification models developed with the decision tree software See5 (www.rulequest.com). Training data for the image classifications consisted of 50–150 multi-pixel patches distributed throughout the extent of each class. As a result, the number of training pixels for each class was in the thousands. In mountainous areas, sunlit and shadowed versions of major land-cover types were treated as separate classes and then later combined (Helmer et al. 2000).

The maps for 1991 and 2000 identify forest types down to the formation level. Forest includes lands with >25% cover of trees or trees that co-dominate with shrubs. Drought deciduous woodland includes lands with 25–60% (open) or >60% (dense) canopy cover dominated by drought deciduous leguminous shrubs and a relatively clear understory that indicates grazing and that may include herbaceous vegetation. Pasture and grass may have up to 25% woody vegetation cover. Cloud forest includes elfin, palm, and tall cloud forests, as well as forests that are transitional to cloud forests. Low to medium density urban and developed areas included lands with as little as 10–15% manmade covers. Consequently, they include some forest or grassland. High density urban lands had >80% cover of man-made structures.

Manual editing of the image-based maps was required to correct for confusion between urban, bare, and senescent pasture lands. We also manually delineated agriculture, inactive agricultural land, and hay/improved pasture in alluvial lowlands for the 2000 classification date. Some confusion between sun coffee and pasture was also manually edited in both dates. We applied the 1991 agricultural delineations from Helmer et al. (2002) for the 1991 time step. We also manually edited the boundary between semi-deciduous and evergreen forest in one part of the island. Finally, seasonally flooded savannas and woodlands were manually delineated in seasonally inundated areas, mainly along the southern coast. The manually interpreted area was 3.2% in 2000, and 5.8% in 1991, of the total area mapped.

For both classification dates, a stratified random sample generated about 50 validation points for each land cover class. The validation points for the 1991 classification came from Helmer et al. (2002). The aerial photographs for 1991 and 1999 served as reference data for identifying the class of each validation point in 1991 and 2000, respectively. The aerial photography eliminated restrictions on point locations, permitting us to include points that would otherwise not be accessible because of topography, remoteness, or property ownership. An error matrix was produced for each mapped class that estimates the overall percentage of correctly classified pixels, producer and user's accuracies, and the kappa coefficient.",US Department of Agriculture; Colorado State University,"Kennaway, Todd A.; Helmer, Eileen H. 2023.

For managers, we include background on current and forthcoming solutions to the problems of mapping detailed tropical forest types with Landsat imagery. In the study area, Trinidad and Tobago, class characteristics like deciduousness allowed discrimination of floristic classes. We also discovered that we could identify most of the tree communities in (1) imagery with fine spatial resolution of 61 m; (2) multiseason fine resolution imagery (viewable with Google Earth); or (3) Landsat imagery from different dates, particularly imagery from drought years, even if decades old, allowing us to collect the extensive training data needed for mapping tropical forest types with ‘‘noisy’’ gap-filled imagery. Further, we show that gap-filled, synthetic multiseason Landsat imagery significantly improves class-specific accuracy for several seasonal forest associations. The class-specific improvements were better for comparing classification results; for in some cases increases in overall accuracy were small.

Standard methods for automated image classification, however, limit classification detail in complex tropical landscapes. In this study, we first test an approach to image interpretation for mapping forest formations and land-cover on four islands of the Lesser Antilles. Secondly, we estimate the extents of land cover and protected forest by formation for five islands and examine whether cultivated areas or forest cover changed over the second half of the 20th century. The image interpretation approach stacks image mosaics with ancillary geographic data, classifying the resulting stack of raster data with decision tree software. Cloud-free image mosaics for one or two seasons were created by applying regression tree normalization to alternate scene dates to fill cloudy areas in a base scene. The approach accurately distinguished several classes that would be confused with more standard methods; the seamless mosaics aided reference data collection; and the multiseason imagery allowed us to separate drought deciduous forests and woodlands from semi-deciduous ones.

Cultivated land areas declined 60 to 100 percent from about 1945 to 2000 on several islands. Meanwhile, forest cover has increased 50 to 950%. Unless sugar cane cultivation becomes more profitable and competitive on the islands where it previously dominated agriculture, this trend will likely continue. Like the island of Puerto Rico, most higher-elevation forest formations are protected in formal or informal reserves. Lowland forests, however, which are drier forest types on these islands, are not well represented in reserves. Former cultivated lands in lowland areas could provide lands for new forest conservation reserves of drier forest types.

Nearly 90% (923 km2) of land reclamation occurred in Asia linked to recent advances in economic development during the middle-income stage. Additional historical mapping and 5-year interval analyses revealed that while human alterations were insignificant during the low-income stages, estuaries were predominantly altered during their middle-income stages, where estuarine degradation is a common consequence of economic growth.

Towards that goal, we first assemble a database of tree species functional traits and other characteristics. Secondly, we apply two approaches to modeling and mapping several attributes of forests including: a) counts and relative basal areas of introduced, native and endemic tree species; b) relative basal areas of selected functional groups; c) forest structure and biomass; and d) individual tree species distributions.

The study area is a collection of Caribbean islands encompassing Puerto Rico, including Vieques, Culebra and Mona and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.

The tropical forest types range from young and old secondary forest to old forest, and from dry forests to humid forests including deciduous, semi-deciduous and evergreen forests including cloud forests. Soils include alluvial soils that are mostly in lowland areas, and soils formed over limestone, volcanic, and serpentine substrates. Most limestone areas have complex karst topography. For a given climate, forests formed on limestone and serpentine substrates have leaf types or growth forms leaning toward those of drier forests, given fast-draining soils.

Monthly extent products are also available as geographic information systems (GIS) compatible shapefiles. Comma delimited ASCII text data files contain monthly mean extent and area, in millions of square kilometers, by year. These monthly extent numbers are used for graphs of extent anomalies with trend lines and significance intervals. Anomalies and median extent are calculated using a 30-year climatology from 1981 through 2010. A climatology, in this instance, is defined as the sea ice extent averaged over a period of time.

Daily images show sea ice extent, with an outline of the median extent for that day for comparison, and sea ice concentration. Comma delimited ASCII text data files contain daily extent, in millions of square kilometers, for almost every day from 1978 onward. These daily extent numbers are used for graphs of daily extent over the last four months. The daily products are good for tracking the seasonal growth and retreat of ice, but there are more accurate views of sea ice on any given day. For example, the Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent (MASIE) products show daily extent at 4 km resolution and are distributed in partnership with the operational National Ice Center (NIC).

We also illustrate relationships between forest vertical structure, disturbance type and counts of forage species important to the Kirtland's Warbler. The ALI imagery and the Landsat time series are both critical to the result for forest height, which the strong relationship of forest height with disturbance type and age facilitates. Also unique to this study is that seven of the eight image time steps are cloud-cleared images: mosaics of the clear parts of several cloudy scenes. We created each cloud-cleared image, including a virtually seamless ALI image mosaic, with regression tree normalization.

The Caribbean Vegetation Classification and Atlas Project has been a key step towards characterizing the natural vegetation and landcover of the region, island-by-island, based on a newly derived standardized vegetation and classification system. This Project has involved the following key steps: - review of existing vegetation classification efforts - convening of a Caribbean Vegetation Ecology Working Group - development of a Standard Classification System for the Caribbean - production of a Vegetation and Landcover Atlas following the newly derived standard classification system

After an exhaustive review of existing vegetation classification systems, a standardized vegetation classification system was developed and set of maps which characterize the vegetation types of the Caribbean in a scientifically consistent manner.","A total of 104 vegetation formations were recognized for the Caribbean region—24 of which are new to the ICEC system. These 104 units are estimated to cover about 95% of the theoretical total number of vegetation formations potentially existing in the Caribbean islands. Descriptions of the Caribbean vegetation formations were developed, arranged with respect to their subordinate position within each major category of the ICEC system. Each standard term corresponding to a formation was accompanied by a short, abbreviated name both in English and Spanish, to be used as a mapping label. The most important formations—according to this new Caribbean system—were crosslisted with their equivalent vegetation units used in previous local or regional classification systems in the Caribbean, and a table with 438 components was developed. This effort, presented in Chapter Four, reconciled 21 of the most important vegetation systems used throughout the Caribbean islands.

A detailed, preliminary system of classification of the vegetation communities of the Caribbean Islands at the more precise alliances and associations level was also developed. Given the complexity of an archipelago that is considered one of the richest in the world in terms of plants species and communities, this was an extraordinary task. The new Caribbean vegetation system, based upon FGDC's classification standards recognized, named, and described 187 alliances. In addition, 199 associations were recognized and named. More than 90% of the associations were also briefly described, based onthe knowledge of the Vegetation Ecology Experts Working Group (See Appendix Three). This classification effort is estimated to have included about 50% of the theoretical total number of vegetation alliances and about 30% of all associations present in the Caribbean islands, many of which are still to be defined, named, and described.

We classified multi-part Landsat ETM+ imagery scenes that were pan-sharpened for the year 2000. Cloudy parts of the reference dates for each scene were replaced by image data from cloud-free parts of other image dates. Scene parts for non-reference dates had been radiometrically matched to reference dates for each scene with regression tree models, and cloud-filled scenes were radiometrically matched to each other with histogram matching. The imagery scenes and extents included the following:

Ancillary data were combined with satellite imagery to create an island-wide predictor variable dataset for image classification. Topographic variables, derived from USGS 30 m digital elevation models (DEM) included elevation, slope, aspect, curvature and facet. Climatic variables included mean annual precipitation and temperature. Vector derived variables included distance to roads, distance to streams (ghuts) and distance to coastlines. Finally, band indices and ratios were created from the Landsat image bands to produce the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 4/5 band ratio. The ancillary predictor data were spatially co-registered with the cloud free image mosaics for the two time periods and stacked with the native Landsat reflectance bands 1-5 and 7 at a spectral resolution of 15 m, resulting in a 18 band image for each classification time period.

Field reference surveys were performed during a reconnaissance visit in 2004 to collect training and reference data. The island wide field surveys and expert consultation with regional vegetation experts enabled us to discern land cover attributes and forest formation from 1 m IKONOS panchromatic sharpened imagery and 1 m color DOQQs. Land-cover and forest formation were then identified in the satellite imagery based on a comparison to areas interpreted in reference imagery and the spatial location of field reference survey data. Forest formation was identifiable in both the reference imagery and the Landsat imagery by a number of factors including spectral components such as color, contrast, tone and texture as well as spatial indicators including geology and elevation. Difficulties distinguishing forest formation were encountered in transitional areas including semi-deciduous and seasonal evergreen forest. Field survey data collected meeting this criteria proved useful in the identification of uncertain forest transitions.

The decision tree classifier See5 (www.rulequest.com) was used for landcover and forest formation classification of Landsat ETM+ imagery for the year 2000. Training data polygons for each land-cover and land-use class were converted to an ASCII point file providing spatial coordinates, class name and assigned class number. The classification was performed with a 10 trial adaptive boosting option to improve the overall accuracy by combining many decision trees into a single combined classifier. This process provides more predicted data to analyze before determining each final class (www.rulequest.com). The default global pruning option was also used to reduce the likelihood of over fitting the tree to the training data. The pruning process removes predicted parts of the decision tree with relatively high error rates and makes decisions as to the final class assignment.

Manual edit confused classes using 1 m IKONOS multispectral imagery and 1 m DOQQ reference data.

Manually digitize areas where remaining cloud and cloud shadow artifacts exist in image mosaics.

A stratified random sample generated approximately 50 validation points for each landcover class. The 1 m IKONOS imagery (dates ranging from 2000 to 2003) and DOQQ (2004) data were used to verify the accuracy assessment points for each class in the classified images. Using high resolution imagery to validate the classification eliminated restrictions on point locations, permitting us to include points that would otherwise not be accessible because of topography, remoteness, or property ownership. An error matrix was produced for each mapped class that estimates the overall percentage of correctly classified pixels, producer and user's accuracies, and the kappa coefficient.",US Department of Agriculture; Colorado State University,"Kennaway, Todd A.; Helmer, Eileen H.; Lefsky, Michael A.; Brandeis, Tom J.; Sherrill, Kirk R. 2021.

79,aafc_can_agri_2023,active,29/04/2024,Naema_GrosDubois,Annual Crop Inventory - Canada,english; french,"Understanding the state and trends in agriculture production is essential to combat both short-term and long-term threats to stable and reliable access to food for all, and to ensure a profitable agricultural sector. Starting in 2009, the Earth Observation Team of the Science and Technology Branch (STB) at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) began the process of generating annual crop type digital maps. Focusing on the Prairie Provinces in 2009 and 2010, a Decision Tree (DT) based methodology was applied using optical (Landsat-5, AWiFS, DMC) and radar (Radarsat-2) based satellite images. Beginning with the 2011 growing season, this activity has been extended to other provinces in support of a national crop inventory. To date this approach can consistently deliver a crop inventory that meets the overall target accuracy of at least 85% at a final spatial resolution of 30m (56m in 2009 and 2010).","For 15 years the Earth Observation Team of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) has been mapping crop types of individual fields in Canada. They developed an operational software system to decipher crop types using satellite observations and trustworthy ground information. Successful crop identification relies on image acquisitions from multiple sensors during key crop phenological stages (reproduction, seed development and senescence). 

Multi-temporal optical data are the primary data source for crop classification because the NIR/SWIR channels are vital to crop classifications. Over a growing season, a minimum of three optical images are required to successfully identify crops. To the optical data, c-band radar data is added to help with physical plant structures and moisture measurements. In 2009 and 2010 the ScanSAR mode of RADARSAT-2, with its large swath (300 km) and moderate resolution (50 m), was used as it fits the agricultural landscape of the Prairie Provinces. From 2011-2019, the finer resolution of RADARSAT2’s Wide mode (30 m) was used, as it is better suited to the smaller fields in the rest of Canada. This finer resolution SAR data continues today with 30m Compact-Pol data from RCM. 

Annual crop insurance data are the most accurate, detailed and complete sources of information for crop types in Canada. As such, AAFC has agreements with some provincial crop insurance agencies to use their data for the training and validation of the classification process. For provinces where insurance data cannot be accessed, ground-truth information is provided by point observations from AAFC staff or other provincial sources. Each year, AAFC staff collects tens of thousands of points identifying crops across the country. These point sources are combined and used as training or reference sites as well. 

The training and validation data used to classify non-agricultural land cover types comes from numerous Land Cover / Land Use products, including the AAFC semi-decadal land use time series. Point data are taken from these products and adjusted (eliminating any that were in transitions areas between classes or in areas of high potential change (i.e. near urban expansion)). What remains is a stable series of known land cover points for the following classes: water, barren, urban, shrubland, wetland, grassland, agriculture (generalized), and forest. 

Focusing on the Prairie Provinces in 2009 and 2010, a Decision Tree (DT) based methodology was applied using optical (Landsat-5, AWiFS, DMC) and radar (RADARSAT-2) imagery. The final map had a spatial resolution of 56m. 

For the 2011 and 2012 growing season, this activity was extended to all the other provinces (except Newfoundland) in support of a national crop inventory. The final spatial resolution was increased to 30m, to aid in differentiating the smaller fields in the rest of Canada.  For 2012, the lack of affordable optical data forced AAFC to rely mostly on RADARSAT-2 data. 

In 2013, this activity expanded to include Newfoundland for the first time, and move to Landsat-8 as its sole-source of optical imagery. RADARSAT-2 continued to be the source of radar imagery. This combination of optical and radar imagery had been repeated over the agricultural extent of Canada in the subsequent years, until 2016 when Sentinel-2 and Gaofen-1 optical imagery were added. The Gaofen imagery was dropped after the 2017 season. For the 2021 map, the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) satellites became the source of radar imagery. In 2022, Landsat-9 imagery was added to the optical collection. 

At present, this approach can consistently deliver a crop inventory that meets the overall target accuracy of at least 85% at a final spatial resolution of 30m. 

Note: At the national scale, the crop type legend is not homogeneous. In some provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Quebec, we have been able to divide the crop types in to sub-categories (i.e. winter versus spring wheat). For other provinces, those classes may not have been subdivided. A lack of training sites and, in some cases, a limited availability of spectral data does not allow for the differentiation of crops into sub-categories with sufficient precision. This can result in class discontinuities between provinces.",Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,"Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 2023, “Annual SpaceBased Crop Inventory for Canada, 2023”, Agroclimate, Geomatics and Earth Observation Division, Science and Technology Branch. https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/ba2645d5-4458-414d-b1966303ac06c1c9  (accessed 29/04/2024)",2023,TRUE,Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,agri-geomatics-agrog@agr.gc.ca,Open Government Licence - Canada,https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada,NA,https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/ba2645d5-4458-414d-b196-6303ac06c1c9,NA,NA,TRUE,Various,Canada,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The SBFI polygons represent homogeneous forest conditions akin to those of stands delineated in a strategic forest inventory. Over 25 million SBFI polygons were delineated using a multiresolution segmentation algorithm applied to the 2020 Landsat surface-reflectance BAP image composite (30-m spatial resolution), fire year, and harvest year layers derived from Landsat with the C2C approach. A minimum map unit of 0.45 ha (5 pixels) was used to define polygons. The entirety of Canada’s forest ecosystems were mapped using the same data, attributes, and temporal representation, resulting in a common vegetation inventory system of Canada’s ~650 Mha forested ecosystems. Given the large and diverse forest area of Canada, the strength of an SBFI lies in its use of a consistent data source and methodology across jurisdictional boundaries, and across managed and unmanaged forest areas, enabling consistently generated synoptic, spatially explicit information outputs. The data included herein are based upon free and open satellite data and information products following established and communicated approaches.","Satellite data are increasingly used to provide information to support forest monitoring and reporting at varying levels of detail and for a range of attributes and spatial extents. Forests are dynamic environments and benefit from regular assessments to capture status and changes both locally and over large areas. Satellite data can provide products relevant to forest science and management on a regular basis (e.g. annually) for land cover, disturbance (i.e. date, extent, severity, and type), forest recovery (e.g. quantification of return of trees following disturbance), and forest structure (e.g. volume, biomass, canopy cover, stand height), with products generated over large areas in a systematic, transparent, and repeatable fashion. While pixel-based outcomes are typical based upon satellite data inputs, many end users continue to require polygon-based forest inventory information. To meet this information need and have a spatial context for forest inventory attributes such as tree species assemblages, we present a new work-flow to produce a novel spatially explicit, stand-level satellite-based forest inventory (SBFI) in Canada applying image segmentation approaches to generate spatially unique forest stands (polygons), which are the fundamental spatial unit of management-level inventories. Thus, SBFI offers spatial context to aggregate and generalize other pixel-based forest data sets. Canada has developed a National Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring System (NTEMS) that utilizes medium spatial resolution imagery, chiefly from Landsat, to annually characterize Canada’s forests at a pixel level from 1984 until present. These NTEMS datasets are used to populate SBFI polygons with information regarding status (e.g. current land cover type, dominant tree species, or total biomass) as well as information on dynamics (e.g. has this polygon been subject to change, when, by what, and if so, how is the forest recovering). Here, we outline the information drivers for forest monitoring, present a set of products aimed at meeting these information needs, and follow to demonstrate the SBFI concept over the 650-Mha extent of Canada’s forest-dominated ecosystems. In so doing, the entirety of Canada’s forest ecosystems (managed and unmanaged) were mapped using the same data, attributes, and temporal representation. Moreover, the use of polygons allows for the generation of attributes such as tree species composition, and total biomass and wood volume in a stand-scale format familiar to landscape managers and suitable for strategic planning. The data, methods, and outcomes presented here are portable to other regions and input data sources, and the national SBFI outcomes for Canada are available via open access.",Natural Resources Canada,"Wulder, M.A., Hermosilla, T., White, J.C., Hobart, G.W., Bater, C.W., Bronson, S.C., 2024.

In the study area, Trinidad and Tobago, class characteristics like deciduousness allowed discrimination of floristic classes. We also discovered that we could identify most of the tree communities in (1) imagery with fine spatial resolution of 61 m; (2) multiseason fine resolution imagery (viewable with Google Earth); or (3) Landsat imagery from different dates, particularly imagery from drought years, even if decades old, allowing us to collect the extensive training data needed for mapping tropical forest types with ‘‘noisy’’ gap-filled imagery. Further, we show that gap-filled, synthetic multiseason Landsat imagery significantly improves class-specific accuracy for several seasonal forest associations. The class-specific improvements were better for comparing classification results; for in some cases increases in overall accuracy were small. These detailed mapping efforts can lead to new views of tropical forest landscapes.

The employment of any supervised classifier demands exhaustive definition of land cover classes and the representation of all classes in the training stage. This paper reports the process of a data driven class separability analysis and the definition and application of a national land cover classification scheme. All Landsat data recorded over Mexico in the year 2000 with cloud coverage below 10 percent and a national digital elevation model have been used. Automatic wall-2-wall image classification has been performed trained by national reference data on land use and vegetation types with 66 classes. Validation has been performed against field plots of the national forest inventory. Groups of non-separable classes have subsequently been discerned by automatic iterative class aggregation. Class aggregations have finally been manually revised and modified towards a proposed national land cover classification scheme at 4 levels with 35 classes at the highest level including 13 classes for primary temperate and tropical forests, 2 classes for secondary temperate and tropical forest, 1 for induced or cultivated forest, as also 8 different scrubland classes. The remaining 11 classes cover agriculture, grassland, wetland, water bodies, urban and other vegetation land cover classes. The remaining 3 levels provide further hierarchic aggregations with 14, 10, and 8 classes, respectively. Trained by the relabeled training dataset wall-2-wall classification towards the 35 classes has been performed. The final national land cover dataset has been validated against more than 200,000 polygons randomly distributed all over the country with class labels derived by manual interpretation. The agreement for all 35 classes at level 4 was 71%. Primary forest classes have been identified with accuracies between 60% and 83%. Secondary forest classes rated only 50% finding major confusion with the primary forest classes. Accuracies over the scrubland classes have been calculated between 60% and 90%.

This file is the map of land cover and forest formations for about the year 2000 for Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra. These data are the original basis for the 2001 NLCD data from the USGS.

Important notes: 
1. Open drought deciduous woodlands, with 25 to 60% woody vegetation cover, are grouped with pasture in the version of this map that is generalized to land cover. 
2. Low density urban lands are included with the Urban class and may have as little as 10-15% urban/built-up lands. 
3. Errors from minor misregristration between the maps from 1991-2000 will cause some error in analyses of change. 
4. We recommend using urban change data from Helmer and Ruefenacht (2005) to estimate urban change from 1991-2000. 

On the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, forest, urban/built-up and pasture lands have replaced most formerly cultivated lands. The extent and age distribution of each forest type that undergoes land development, however, is unknown. This study assembles a time series of four land-cover maps for Puerto Rico. The time series includes two digitized paper maps of land cover in 1951 and 1978 that are based on photo interpretation. The other two maps are of forest type and land cover and are based on decision tree classification of Landsat image mosaics dated 1991 and 2000. With the map time series we quantify land-cover changes from 1951 to 2000; map forest age classes in 1991 and 2000; and quantify the forest that undergoes land development (urban development or surface mining) from 1991 to 2000 by forest type and age. This step relies on intersecting a map of land development from 1991-2000 (from the same satellite imagery) with the forest age and type maps. Land-cover changes from 1991-2000 that continue prior trends include urban expansion and transition of sugar cane, pineapple and other lowland agriculture to pasture. Forest recovery continues, but it has slowed. Emergent and forested wetland area increased between 1977 and 2000. Sun coffee cultivation appears to have increased slightly. Most of the forests cleared for land development, 55 percent, were young (1-13 yr). Only 13 percent of the developed forest was older (41-55+ yr).

The data was created with two levels of accuracy: one in accordance with EU requirements and the other for national use. The material consists of a raster-format spatial database (resolution 20 * 20 m) and a vector-format spatial database, where the smallest area that stands out in the terrain is at least 25 ha and the narrowest is 100 meters.

Standard methods for automated image classification, however, limit classification detail in complex tropical landscapes. In this study, we first test an approach to image interpretation for mapping forest formations and land-cover on four islands of the Lesser Antilles. Secondly, we estimate the extents of land cover and protected forest by formation for five islands and examine whether cultivated areas or forest cover changed over the second half of the 20th century. The image interpretation approach stacks image mosaics with ancillary geographic data, classifying the resulting stack of raster data with decision tree software. Cloud-free image mosaics for one or two seasons were created by applying regression tree normalization to alternate scene dates to fill cloudy areas in a base scene. The approach accurately distinguished several classes that would be confused with more standard methods; the seamless mosaics aided reference data collection; and the multiseason imagery allowed us to separate drought deciduous forests and woodlands from semi-deciduous ones.

Cultivated land areas declined 60 to 100 percent from about 1945 to 2000 on several islands. Meanwhile, forest cover has increased 50 to 950%. Unless sugar cane cultivation becomes more profitable and competitive on the islands where it previously dominated agriculture, this trend will likely continue. Like the island of Puerto Rico, most higher-elevation forest formations are protected in formal or informal reserves. Lowland forests, however, which are drier forest types on these islands, are not well represented in reserves. Former cultivated lands in lowland areas could provide lands for new forest conservation reserves of drier forest types.

We present the first digital map of seafloor lithologies based on descriptions of nearly 14,500 samples from original cruise reports, interpolated using a support vector machine algorithm. We show that sediment distribution is more complex, with significant deviations from earlier hand-drawn maps, and that major lithologies occur in drastically different proportions globally. By coupling our digital map to oceanographic data sets, we find that the global occurrence of biogenic oozes is strongly linked to specific ranges in sea-surface parameters. In particular, by using recent computations of diatom distributions from pigment-calibrated chlorophyll-a satellite data, we show that, contrary to a widely held view, diatom oozes are not a reliable proxy for surface productivity. Their global accumulation is instead strongly dependent on low surface temperature (0.9–5.7 °C) and salinity (33.8–34.0 PSS, Practical Salinity Scale 1978) and high concentrations of nutrients. Under these conditions, diatom oozes will accumulate on the seafloor regardless of surface productivity as long as there is limited competition from biogenous and detrital components, and diatom frustules are not significantly dissolved prior to preservation.

The detailed mapping of vegetation types, called physiognomies, is still a challenge due to their high spectral similarity and spatial variability. There are three major ecosystem groups (forest, savanna, and grassland), which can be hierarchically subdivided into 25 detailed physiognomies, according to a well-known classification system. We used an adapted U-net architecture to process a WorldView-2 image with 2-m spatial resolution to hierarchically classify the physiognomies of a Cerrado protected area based on deep learning techniques. Several spectral channels were tested as input datasets to classify the three major ecosystem groups (first level of classification). The dataset composed of RGB bands plus 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) achieved the best performance and was used to perform the hierarchical classification. In the first level of classification, the overall accuracy was 92.8%. On the other hand, for the savanna and grassland detailed physiognomies (second level of classification), 86.1% and 85.0% were reached, respectively. As the first work that intended to classify Cerrado physiognomies in this level of detail using deep learning, our accuracy rates outperformed others that applied traditional machine learning algorithms for this task.",NA,INPE; Vale Institute of Technology; Leibniz Universität Hannover,"Neves, Alana & Körting, Thales & Fonseca, Leila & Soares, Anderson & Girolamo Neto, Cesare & Heipke, Christian.

Because of the biodiversity richness and high levels of endemism, Cerrado is considered one of world's hotspot for biodiversity conservation. The objectives of this study are three-fold: to present a comprehensive division of Cerrado into different ecoregions that reflect the environmental heterogeneity within the biome; to analyze the ecoregions in terms of biophysical characteristics, protected areas, environmental liability in riparian permanent protection areas along watercourses, and priorities for biodiversity conservation; and to rank the ecoregions in terms of endangerment for biodiversity conservation and restoration. A previous study that delineated 22 ecoregions using geomorphology, vegetation, soil, geology, and plant diversity maps was revised using topography, vegetation, precipitation, and soil maps. Our new ecoregion map consists of 19 units that are unique in terms of landscape characteristics and has been adjusted to the current official boundary map of Cerrado. Some of the ecoregions consist of only one geomorphological compartment, whereas others are heterogeneous, consisting of up to eight compartments. Ferralsols comprise the dominant soil type in 14 of the ecoregions. The percentage of protected areas within ecoregions ranges from 1.7% to 51.5%. The most endangered ecoregion, where land use change critically threatens habitat integrity, is the Depressão Cárstica do São Francisco (states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Piauí), where environmental liability along riparian permanent protection areas amounts to 85.6% of the total area. Our proposed ecoregion map provides a spatial framework for regional and local assessments to improve decision-making processes to reconcile conservation and restoration planning, sustainable agriculture, and provision of ecosystem services. Besides de adjustment of the previous Cerrado's ecoregion map to the official biome boundary (relevant for the implementation of public policies of conservation as those regulated by the Brazilian Forest Code), the new analyses of the ecoregion map represent a substantial improvement in comparison to the ones conducted by the previous study in 2003. In addition, current web resources allow us to make all the information used or derived from this study available to other users.

IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. 
IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. 
The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.

TCFs are threatened by direct human pressures and climate change, yet the fate of these extraordinary ecosystems remains insufficiently quantified. With discussions of the post-2020 biodiversity framework underway, TCFs are a defining test case of the success and promise of recent policy targets and their associated mechanisms to avert the global biodiversity crisis. Here we present a global assessment of the recent status and trends of TCFs and their biodiversity and evaluate the efficacy of current protection measures. We find that cloud forests occupied 0.4% of the global land surface in 2001 and harboured ~3,700 species of birds, mammal, amphibians and tree ferns (~15% of the global diversity of those groups), with half of those species entirely restricted to cloud forests. Worldwide, ~2.4% of cloud forests (in some regions, more than 8%) were lost between 2001 and 2018, especially in readily accessible places. While protected areas have slowed this decline, a large proportion of loss in TCF cover is still occurring despite formal protection.

Although the mapping of agricultural and urban ecosystems was also a goal, the primary target areas were areas closer to nature. During the preparation of the basic map, a ""bottom-up"" mapping model was implemented, which on the one hand relies on already existing thematic databases that reflect the real situation as much as possible, and on the other hand supplements and clarifies them based on remote sensing methods. An important aspect was the use of regularly updated databases, thus creating the possibility of updating the map in the future. The base year is 2015, but the range of databases used also includes Sentinel optical and radar space images for the year 2017. The studies establishing the methodology, and then the mapping itself, as consortium partners of the nature conservation project, are the remote sensing and geoinformatics departments of the Lechner Knowledge Center (as the legal successor of the Earth Survey and Remote Sensing Institute, FÖMI), the Ecology and Botany Institute of the Ecological Research Center (ÖK ÖBI) and the Agricultural Science Research Center Soil and Agrochemistry It was carried out by the staff of the Institute (ATK TAKI) with the support and professional supervision of the Department of Nature Conservation (AM TMF) of the Ministry of Agriculture - as project coordinator.","In order to develop version 4.0 of the Ecosystem Basemap, we implemented an increasingly widespread ""bottom-up"" mapping model during the preparation of land cover and land use maps. Among the databases with spatial relevance reviewed for the solution of the task, we used the LPIS land cover layer as a basis, due to its national coverage and its relatively high thematic and spatial resolution for a significant part of the country. To complement this, additional databases with different thematic focus were used (e.g. Copernicus High Resolution Land Cover Layers (HRL) Water and Wetness (WAW) layer for reference year 2015; Forest Information System (ESZIR) data) and we put great emphasis on the own processing of data collected by remote sensing methods during the production of otherwise data-deficient topics (e.g. different types of lawns). The resulting data were organized into a theoretical cube with uniform geometry (20 meter raster) and projection (ETRS1989 LAEA), then purposeful, cell-based queries (Python based) were used to generate the individual result categories and thus the basemap (in GeoTiff format). The basemap, considered quasi-final, was subjected to a thematic quality review, the experiences and results of which provided further input for the final clarifications. Regarding the result layer, it is important to note that its scale can be characterized by spatial and thematic accuracy determined by the source databases, which may vary from thematic class to topic, and in fact the 20 x 20 meter grid geometry can only be considered as a representation resolution. The Ecosystem Basemap is made up of six main categories. 

1. The boundaries of the main category artificial surfaces (Urban) are mainly provided by the artificial land cover elements of the LPIS land cover database (e.g. settlements, farmsteads, industrial areas, mines, landfills, transport infrastructure, etc.). Its filling with detailed geometry and thematic content was ensured by thematic databases (e.g. road database, altitude model) and remote sensing results based on Sentinel space images (primarily in the separation of built and green areas). 
2. The boundaries of the main category Croplands are also defined in the LPIS FSB. database elements. Content is also uploaded by the LPIS. database, additional information was provided by the VINGIS database, and in some areas ESZIR-OEA also helped us. 
3. The boundaries of the main category Grasslands and other herbaceous vegetation are mainly defined in the LPIS FSB. database containing grasslands, but also includes clearings included in the ESIROEA database. The strengthening of grassland boundaries and the diversification of the category were solved at the first level by analyzing remotely sensed images and using a learning algorithm (treating the main category together with wetlands in this respect). For this, time series of Sentinel space images (optical 71 and radar), spectral indices derived from them, topographic indices derived from DDM (baseline data) and reference data (NER maps, certain LPIS fsb. categories, permanent turf overlay, etc.) were used. Further diversification was carried out on the basis of expert estimates of limit values for soil parameters. Due to the lack of a proper baseline database on grassland types at national level, there may be confusion between third-level subcategories, with some categories underestimating or overestimating their occurrences. 
4. The main category forests and other woodlands are delimited on the basis of the forest stock repository (OEA) of the Forest Administration Information System (ESZIR), which is supplemented both territorially and in content by woody land cover that is not covered by the ESIR-OEA, but may have woody land cover based on other data sources (e.g. LPIS fsb., remote sensing results) (the latter are categorized as ""woody vegetation n.e.c.). The subcategories were filled with content by experts taking into account the descriptive data of the ESIR.
5. The boundaries of the main category Wetlands are defined in the LPIS FSB. It is given by classes of certain grasslands, other categories of herbaceous vegetation and wetlands. Patches of arable land that are intermittently wet, but otherwise under cultivation, are not included in this category. The demarcation was carried out according to the method described under the main category ""Grasslands and other herbaceous vegetation"". The separation of woody subclasses is ensured by the database of ESZIR-OEA. 
6. In the development of the main category Rivers and lakes, the LPIS fsb. database, the 2015 Waters and wetlands (WAW) Copernicus High Resolution Layer (HRL) permanent water surfaces category and remote sensing results were involved. (Water surfaces identified exclusively by remote sensing are classified as standing waters.) 

As a consequence of semi-automatic processing, we assumed a slight mixing between the subcategories of the completed Ecosystem base map, so we considered it important to check the map thematically. 

The following methods were chosen: 
(1) comparison with databases with similar topics, 
(2) visual inspection by external experts (""Look & feel"" check), and systematic verification and accuracy checking 
(3). The result of a preliminary comparison with the reference data shows that the present version of the NÖSZTÉP basemap is ""strong"" primarily where the LPIS is a basic data: the delimitation of agricultural areas. The slightly lower accuracy of the other categories is due to several factors, which are summarised in general terms as follows: 

Errors accumulated during the production of the basic data and reference data (mapping methodology, accuracy, impact of possible pre- and post-processing methods, e.g. noise cancellation, etc.). 

Errors resulting from differences in thematic and spatial resolution between the basic data and the reference data, as well as distortions resulting from conversion steps required for integration into the common data model. 

Difference between the time aspect of the basic data and the reference data. 

Shortcoming of core databases. 

Thematic breakdown of existing national but profession-specific basic data and differences due to thematic requirements of the target database. 

Methodological errors in the query rule line. 

Despite the errors described above, the completed Ecosystem Basemap can be considered as the first, operational, nationwide implementation of new map data generation using bottom-up, cube-based data integration and remote sensing tools, carried out with the utmost care.","Agrárminisztérium (Ministry of Agriculture, Hungary); Lechner Tudásközpont (LTK); Talajtani és Agrokémiai Intézet (TAKI); Ökológiai Kutatóintézet (ÖK)","Ecosystem base map, Ministry of Agriculture, 2019 (KEHOP-430-VEKOP-15-2016-00001), available from: http://alapterkep.termeszetem.hu/ (accessed 06/06/24)",2019,TRUE,"Lechner Nonprofit Ltd., Directorate of Geospatial Services (ex.FÖMI)",gergely.maucha@lechnerkozpont.hu,CC BY 4.0 ATTRIBUTION 4.0 INTERNATIONAL,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,NA,http://alapterkep.termeszetem.hu/,https://doi.org/10.34811/osz.alapterkep,NA,TRUE,Various,Hungary,TRUE,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One classification approach is terrestrial ecological systems, mid- to local- scale ecological units useful for standardized mapping and conservation assessments of habitat diversity and landscape conditions. Each ecological system type describes complexes of plant communities influenced by similar physical environments and dynamic ecological processes (like fire or flooding). The classification defines some 800 units across the United States and has provided an effective means of mapping ecological concepts at regional/national scales in greater detail than was previously possible.","Standardized ecological classification units form the foundation for effective data collection, assessment, and reporting on ecosystems.  NatureServe described over 800 mid-local-scale classification units from across the United States. These “terrestrial ecological system’’ units are described using multiple plant communities that tend to co-occur based on recurrent similarities in environmental setting and ecological dynamics.  For example, a given forest or grassland system will describe the predominant plant species composition, landforms, soils, drainage, and natural disturbance dynamics.  Wetland or riparian ecological systems will have similar descriptions, and reference the characteristic hydrologic regime.  All types include a description of their known distribution (e.g., by country, state, and ecoregion).
By integrating environmental setting and dynamic ecological processes with vegetation into the concept of each unit, this classification system lends itself to biophysical modeling and robust characterization of wildlife habitat. These units apply well to land cover mapping and may be augmented with modifiers for specific variants in composition and structure resulting in robust, standardized maps. The inter-agency LANDFIRE effort in the United States uses these concepts to develop conceptual “state-and-transition” models to characterize wildfire regimes.  That effort also produces maps of potential/historical and current distribution for most types nationwide. NatureServe maintains national and regional maps of terrestrial ecological system units. Since vegetation types are used in type description, terrestrial ecological system units provide a direct, systematic link to the US National and International Vegetation Classification.  They also provide a useful framework for integration with land-based “ecological site” concepts and descriptions, as used in the United States for forest and rangeland management applications.",Nature Serve,"NatureServe (2014).

NatureServe ecologists lead efforts to develop internationally standardized classifications for terrestrial ecosystems and vegetation. One classification approach is with existing vegetation. The International Vegetation Classification, or EcoVeg approach (Faber-Langendoen et al. in press), grew out of USA federal standards, defining vegetation concepts at multiple thematic levels. Vegetation systems are defined as “moderate sets of diagnostic plant species and diagnostic growth forms that reflect biogeographic differences in composition and sub-continental to regional differences in mesoclimate, geology, substrates, hydrology, and disturbance regimes.” Building from prior national and regional ecological classifications from the area (see Josse et al. 2003; 2007), a hierarchical classification was established for existing vegetation types describing natural upland and wetland conditions. National and regional maps of current extent were reconciled to the standard classification and provided georeferenced locations for use in spatial modeling. Spatial modeling used climate, geophysical data layers, and satellite spectral data, in a sequential process to map potential distributions at several levels of the vegetation classification hierarchy. Inductive modeling in sequential steps, followed by expert review and refinement, resulted in a map of 147 vegetation macrogroups for the North American continent & the Caribbean. This map depicts the location and extent of each macrogroup had there been no intensive human land uses in recent centuries.

These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s land resources, the USGS designed a new generation of NLCD products released in 2016. This innovation continues with design and processing improvements through 2021 and aims to provide consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2021 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in streamlined processes for integrating specialized MRLC partner data along with numerous new datasets, assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and machine learning based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated operational system incorporating AI/ML technologies for NLCD 2021 production.

Building on that work, this paper describes an objectively derived and globally comprehensive set of 37 distinct volumetric region units, called ecological marine units (EMUs). They are constructed on a regularly spaced ocean point-mesh grid, from sea surface to seafloor, and attributed with data from the 2013 World Ocean Atlas version 2.","The point attribute data are the means of the decadal averages from a 57-year climatology of six physical and chemical environment parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate). The database includes over 52 million points that depict the global ocean in x, y, and z dimensions. The point data were statistically clustered to define the 37 EMUs, which represent physically and chemically distinct water volumes based on spatial variation in the six marine environmental characteristics used. The aspatial clustering to produce the 37 EMUs did not include point location or depth as a determinant, yet strong geographic and vertical separation was observed. Twenty-two of the 37 EMUs are globally or regionally extensive, and account for 99% of the ocean volume, while the remaining 15 are smaller and shallower, and occur around coastal features. We assessed the vertical distribution of EMUs in the water column and placed them into classical depth zones representing epipelagic (0 m to 200 m), mesopelagic (200 m to 1,000 m), bathypelagic (1,000 m to 4,000 m) and abyssopelagic (>4,000 m) layers. The mapping and characterization of the EMUs represent a new spatial framework for organizing and understanding the physical, chemical, and ultimately biological properties and processes of oceanic water bodies. The EMUs are an initial objective partitioning of the ocean using long-term historical average data, and could be extended in the future by adding new classification variables and by introducing functionality to develop time-specific EMU distribution maps. The EMUs are an open-access resource, and as both a standardized geographic framework and a baseline physicochemical characterization of the oceanic environment, they are intended to be useful for disturbance assessments, ecosystem accounting exercises, conservation priority setting, and marine protected area network design, along with other research and management applications.",U.S. Geological Survey,"Sayre, R.

131,geobon_global_ecodis_nd,active,14/08/2024,Simi_Komenda,Global Ecosystem Data Cube,english,"The distributions of different ecosystems, from lowland rainforests to alpine wetlands, are a key component of global biodiversity. Accordingly, comprehensive and detailed information on ecosystem distributions in space and their changes through time is urgently needed to support the monitoring framework of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as many other vital applications in science, policy, and management. To address this need, we here present a suite of national indicators of ecosystem-specific annual areas and areal changes. These indicators are based on the GlobES (Global EcoSystems) data cube, which maps the per-pixel areas of >70 terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and oceanic ecosystems annually since 1992 at a high spatial resolution. GlobES builds on recent progress in multi-decadal environmental mapping, integrating state-of-the-art information on land cover and land use, climate, geomorphology, hydrology, and various other environmental factors. For immediate applicability in conservation practice, the ecosystem types correspond to the habitat class scheme of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Extensive validation of the GlobES data cube against millions of ecosystem and species records has shown high overall accuracies (F1-score of 88%) that, however, vary across different regions and ecosystem types. To allow users to factor that uncertainty into their evaluations of ecosystem status and trends, the presented national ecosystem indicators will soon be associated with uncertainty bars, calculated by aggregating the spatiotemporally detailed uncertainty estimates determined for the GlobES ecosystem maps. As the number of available validation records will continue to increase rapidly, the detail and reliability of the GlobES data and of the associated uncertainties will further improve over the coming years. To allow these improvements to also enhance the precision and reliability of ecosystem monitoring, the national ecosystem indicators and their uncertainty bars will be periodically updated.

The GlobES ecosystem data cube currently undergoes final updates, before the final, fully documented datasets will be published as an open-access resource. To already facilitate discussions and planning, preliminary time series of the GlobES-based national ecosystem indicators are currently made available for exploration and download via this website.

We produced this novel habitat map by creating a global decision tree that intersects the best currently available global data on land cover, climate and land use. The maps broaden our understanding of habitats globally, assist in constructing area of habitat (AOH) refinements and are relevant for broad-scale ecological studies and future IUCN Red List assessments. We hope that these data and outlined framework will spur further development of biodiversity-relevant habitat maps at global scales. An interactive interface helping to navigate the map can be found at on the Naturemap website ( https://explorer.naturemap.earth/map).

Provided is the code to recreate the map (to made available soon), the global composite image at native -100m Copernicus resolution for level 1 and level 2 and layers of aggregated fractional cover (unit: [0-1] * 1000) at 1km for level 1 and level 2.

Starting with version 004 there changemasks for the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are supplied. Changemasks for the composite masks show the changed grid cells and their new values with earlier years being nested in later years, e.g. using the changemask for 2019 includes all changes up to 2019. For the fractional cover estimates at ~1km resolution, new fractional cover changemasks are supplied as subtraction (before - after) between the previous and current year (unit range: [-1 to 1] * 1000).

We highlight that only changes in land cover are considered since most of the ancillary layers (e.g. pasture, forest management, climate, etc...) are static and thus not all changes in habitats can be found.

Vegetation mapping covers the land cover of the national territory, according to the Brazilian vegetation classification used by the IBGE. The information was produced in digital format, from 1997 to 2017, based on the compilation of existing data, interpretation of orbital images, field expeditions and bibliographic research. The vector product is made available with complementary tabular information on the classification. The methods used in the mapping are described in the IBGE's Technical Manual of Brazilian Vegetation.","This product comes from the IBGE's Natural Resources Mapping (MRN) activity, which consists of the production, compilation, storage and dissemination of information related to Geology, Geomorphology, Pedology and Vegetation. This activity began with the incorporation, in 1986, into IBGE of the technical-scientific collection and the team of professionals from the RADAM and RADAMBRASIL projects, executed by the Brazilian government in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1997, through the contract with the Commission for the Implementation of the Airspace Control System (CISCEA), the managing unit of the Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM) implementation project, which is an integral part of Censipam (Management and Operational Center for the Amazon Protection System), the publication of existing information for the Legal Amazon began. Between 2004 and 2017, the activity was developed for the rest of the country, through several internal IBGE projects. In a complementary manner, information from other projects was incorporated, with the institution's participation, such as environmental diagnoses and zoning and forest inventories, carried out in specific locations within the national territory.

Throughout the production period, the material was published in cartographic sections corresponding to the International Millionth Map – CIM, and stored in the BDiA (Environmental Information Database). This database contains the vector features that make up the thematic mapping of natural resources, as well as georeferenced points with complementary environmental information, compiled or collected during the work. From 2018 onwards, the data was made available for the entire national territory, in the format of a continuous thematic database.

The cartographic boundaries in the published material underwent changes during the production period, due to methodological corrections and updates. The mapping methods were adapted according to the availability of inputs and resources used in each stage of the work. With scientific and technological advances in knowledge of the types of vegetation in Brazil, the classification was reevaluated, with the inclusion and simplification of land cover classes.

After each sheet was prepared to the nearest millionth, it was made compatible with the adjacent mapped areas, until the entire national territory was mapped in 2017. In that year, the country's boundaries were updated, according to the Continuous Cartographic Base of Brazil at a scale of 1:250,000 (BC250), resulting in some changes to the mapped areas. New revisions were made during the execution of the project “Biomes and Coastal-Marine System of Brazil (scale 1:250,000)”, published in 2019, mainly in the border areas between the Biomes.

The rapid spatial biodiversity assessment that reveals where the biodiversity of the country is found, what state it is in and how it could be prioritised. 

The Mapping Biodiversity Priorities (SANBI and UNEP-WCMC, 2016) approach is a systematic conservation planning approach based on 3 principles:

- The principle of representation is about ensuring that a sample of every species and every ecosystem type is protected or managed for conservation in some way. This avoids the common historical bias towards conserving certain charismatic species, or towards placing protected areas in places where there happen to be few competing land uses, so that only certain species and ecosystem types end up being protected. 
- The principle of persistence is to conserve the key ecological processes that are essential for ensuring that ecosystems and species can persist over time. This can include, for example, keeping ecological corridors intact that allow for species movement and connectivity in the landscape. 
- The third principle is to set quantitative biodiversity targets that guide how much biodiversity should be conserved. These targets underpin both the assessment and the prioritisation process. They can also be used to evaluate the success or impact of conservation actions.

The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) under the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism and with the technical guidance of the University of Botswana, the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) as well as the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) used this approach to develop maps of ecosystem types, ecological condition, ecosystem threat status and ecosystem protection level. These maps support the development of National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) and help prioritise implementation (NBSAP, 2015). They can also feed into national planning, policies and sectoral frameworks to ensure that development does not erode a nation’s natural capital. Phase One of the Mapping Biodiversity Priorities (MBP) project (2017 –2019) laid the foundation for mainstreaming of spatial biodiversity information into government decision making processes in Botswana. Integrated baseline layers were generated and used to conduct spatial biodiversity assessments of ecosystem threat status and protection level.

Moreover, the socio-economic data of stakeholders mapping and mainstreaming entry points were identified.

This Project offered unique opportunity to conduct spatial biodiversity assessments and to engage with a range of stakeholders that support development of evidence based Spatial Biodiversity Assessment (SBA) that enables exploration of sectoral synergies, trade-offs and policy impacts which in turn will improve the country’s technical capacity to curate, analyse and present spatial information, and capability to use it to integrate biodiversity issues into other sectors and national development processes such as transformative National Biodiversity and Strategy and Action Planning (NBSAP), and implementation. The Project also demonstrated the value of spatial data collection, curation and analysis to produce information products that can inform policy processes.

South African Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) and Dr. Stephen Holness (a technical lead from Nelson Mandela University) were partners of the Project that provided critical technical support, and Japan Biodiversity Fund (JBF) was the source fund through Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD).

It introduces two new headline indicators for assessing the state of Uganda’s biodiversity: Ecosystem Threat Status and Ecosystem Protection Level. The primary purpose of the SBA is to provide a high-level summary of the state of Uganda’s biodiversity that can be regularly updated. The SBA is intended for decision-makers both inside and outside the biodiversity sector. It feeds into and links with policy-related processes such as National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan II (2015-2025) (NEMA, 2016), the National Development Plan, and state of environment reporting.

The SBA 2020 was led by the Uganda National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) in partnership with a range of organisations and experts. The SBA 2020 includes themes related to ecosystem classification, pressures on biodiversity, protected areas, the threat status and protection level of ecosystems, and an initial analysis of priority biodiversity hotspots.

The project applied the methodology outlined in Mapping Biodiversity Priorities: A Practical, Science- Based Approach to National Biodiversity Assessment and Prioritisation to Inform Strategy and Action Planning (SANBI and UNEP-WCMC, 2016)1.

146,urwan_rwan_eco_2022,active,18/06/2024,Naema_GrosDubois,Rwanda Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 2022,english,"A new fine scale map of Rwanda’s ecosystems was developed, which identified 29 ecosystems across 9 biomes.","The recent Rwanda landcover map (Esri Rwanda Ltd., 2018) was the primary input into the ecological condition map. It is a useful starting point but has a number of issues. Although urban areas are well covered, individual buildings and even villages in rural areas are often below the resolution of the dataset. Roads are not mapped.  In a number of cases natural and severely or irreversibly modified areas are combined in a single category. For example, natural forests and artificial (human-planted) forest plantations are a single category; dams and lakes are not distinguished from each other; and natural open areas and open ground are not distinguished from impacted land cover classes. Some natural landcover classes are misidentified as impacted classes; for example, large areas of alpine herbaceous vegetation within Volcanoes NP are mapped as agriculture. Therefore, for the SBA analysis the ecological condition map was produced based on the best available data from the landcover and several additional sources: 

• Selected landcover classes were used from the land use /land cover map (Esri Rwanda Ltd., 2018). These were: Permanent and seasonal agriculture & Settlements and buildings (covering urban areas, including industrial and mining areas). 
• Point data on buildings (especially useful for rural villages and households in farmland) and data on settlement areas were collated from the OpenStreetMap data (Open Street Map, 2022a).  
• Roads data on roads and tracks were collated from the OpenStreetMap data (Open Street Map, 2022b). 
• Selected landcover classes, such as coffee, were specifically mapped in the erosion mapping dataset (Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2020). 
• Dams were identified from the Rwandan toposheet data (Rwanda Surveys and Mapping, 2022b). 
• Plantations (Eucalyptus and Pine), including small woodlots were mapped from the 2019 forest dataset (Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2019). 
• Alien bamboo areas from the 2019 forest dataset (Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2019). 
• Tea plantations were mapped from a slightly older but high quality spatial dataset (National Agricultural Export Development Board, 2016). 

To reduce misclassification, natural areas were identified from a number of data sources. These were used to over-ride more general data from the land use/ land cover dataset (Esri Rwanda Ltd., 2018): 
• Natural forest specifically mapped in the 2019 forest dataset (Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2019). 
• Data on intact natural wetlands from the 2016 SWAM wetlands dataset (Rwanda Water Resources Board, 2016) was used to identify intact natural areas of wetlands.  
• It was assumed that high altitude herbaceous alpine areas within national parks were natural rather than agricultural lands. This was based on a combination of the draft ecosystem map (SANBI, 2022) and the Protected Areas dataset (IUCN, 2021; Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2022a). 
• It was assumed that the fine scale ecosystems specifically mapped and identified for gazetting as protected ecosystems are natural (Biodiversity Conservation, Environmental Management and Rural Development, 2015; Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2022b).  

The various datasets were integrated as follows: 
• Where there are known natural areas mapped from specific and accurate datasets (i.e. the forest, wetland, Protected Area and protected ecosystems layers), these took priority. These areas were classified as “Natural or Near Natural”. Areas that were not specifically mapped as “Not Natural” were assumed to be “Natural or Near Natural”.   
• Small scale or detailed datasets (e.g. buildings and roads) of “Not Natural” types trumped other more broadly mapped landcover classes. Specifically mapped agricultural or cultivated features trumped other more broadly mapped land use classes. These specially mapped features were tea, bamboo, coffee, artificial plantations and dams. Selected general categories from the Rwanda ESRI landcover were used in areas not otherwise mapped as another landcover class. These were permanent and seasonal agriculture, settlements, industry and mining. 
• After the integration of the two above steps, a GIS based fragmentation analysis was undertaken to identify very small (under 2 ha) areas of isolated areas that had not been specifically mapped as “Natural or Near natural”. We assumed that these very small areas were likely to be highly degraded and hence were reclassified as “Not Natural”.

The analysis highlighted that only 28.3% of Rwanda is likely to be in “Natural or Near Natural” ecological condition.  Importantly, this is a rapid initial analysis: 
• The mapping is largely based on the assumption that anywhere that is not specifically mapped as “Not Natural” is in fact “Natural or Near Natural”. Even with the correction for highly fragmented areas, this is likely to significantly underestimate actual levels of landscape transformation. 
• There is no specific mapping of landscape degradation (e.g. alien invasive vegetation or overgrazing), and no direct mapping of processes that cause degradation of aquatic ecosystems (e.g. pollution). This will result in underestimation of actual threat levels in these ecosystem types. 
• The areas identified as fragmented may include important natural areas. Although the analysis is likely to be broadly accurate, the results should not be used for site level decisions without robust field verification of results. 

Verification and improvement of the ecological condition map should be the focus for any updated assessment. It will result in significantly improved results at a site level. However, it should be noted that the overall pattern of results is likely to be robust.",University of Rwanda’s Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural Resource Management;  Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA); South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI); Nelson Mandela University; NatureServe,"SANBI, CoEB and REMA, 2022, Rwanda Ecosystem Assessment Reamining Areas Only [dataset], University of Rwanda’s Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural Resource Management [dataset], Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) and South African National Biodiversity Institute.",2022,FALSE,Beth Kaplan,Unknown,Unknown,NA,RSBA data.zip,NA,NA,NA,REVIEW,Various,Rwanda,TRUE,"GET alignment review required, follow up on licence",REVIEW,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It introduces two new  headline indicators for assessing the state of Ghana’s biodiversity: Ecosystem Threat Status and Ecosystem  Protection Level. The primary purpose of the SBA is to provide a high-level summary of the state of  Ghana’s biodiversity that can be regularly updated. The SBA is intended for decision-makers both inside  and outside the biodiversity sector. It feeds into and links with policy-related processes such as Ghana’s Sustainable Development Goals and state of environment reporting, like the National Biodiversity  Strategy and Action Plan (MESTI, 2016), National Climate Change Action Plan and the Forestry  Development Master Plan, as well as contributing towards fulfilling AICHI targets of the Global Strategic  Plan for Biodiversity. 

The SBA 2021 was led by the National Biosafety Authority and the Council for Scientific and Industrial  Research in partnership with a range of organisations and experts. The Spatial Biodiversity Assessment is the product of collaborative work of many individuals and institutions with support from the Global  Environment Facility (GEF) through the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC). National  experts worked with international partners from South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI),  Nelson Mandela University and NatureServe. 

The SBA is part of the Connect Project. ‘Connect: mainstreaming biodiversity into the heart of government  decision making’ is a global project funded by the Global Environment Facility, implemented by UN  Environment and executed by UNEP-WCMC. It is a four-year project taking place in three demonstration  countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Uganda, Mozambique and Ghana) to test a proof of concept around the  barriers to using biodiversity information in decision making. The main objective of the project is to ensure  biodiversity is taken into account in decision making across government sectors by improving end-users’  access to and use of biodiversity information with national development decision making processes. 

The SBA 2021 includes themes related to ecosystem classification, pressures on biodiversity, protected  areas, and the threat status and protection level of ecosystems.

This benthic habitat type map represents the first ever high resolution map of coral reef benthic habitat for the entire Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area and is designed to enable a suite of new management, conservation and scientific activities. The benthic classes include: Sand, Rubble, Rock and Coral/Algae. The key below outlines each of the classes in context of what they describe and their corresponding raster value in the data product.","The GBR10 benthic habitat type map is the output of a modelling process that combines satellite imagery and other environmental attributes like water depth, slope and wave climate, along with known occurrences of benthic habitat type. The occurrences of benthic habitat type were derived through machine learning applied to geolocated photos of the benthos (>100,000 photos) that were collected along reef flats and reef slopes at various offshore shallow reefs (~100 reefs). The modelling process involves taking those occurrences of benthic habitat at known locations (training data) and using a machine learning model to build a relationship between benthic habitat type and the underlying data layers (imagery, depth, slope, waves). Because the data layers cover the whole Great Barrier Reef, a prediction is then able to be made for benthic habitat across the whole Great Barrier Reef as well. Contextual editing was then used to make changes to the map, based on a set of geomorphology- and ecology-based rules, such as what environment a class can occur in and what classes are able to neighbour each other (object-based rulesets). This map covers the “offshore” or “mid and outer-shelf” reefs of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

The Copernicus program, and Sentinel-1 (S1) in particular, offers the opportunity to monitor agricultural land at a continental scale and in a timely manner. However, so far the potential of S1 has not been explored at such a scale. Capitalizing on the unique LUCAS 2018 Copernicus in-situ survey, we present the first continental crop type map at 10-m spatial resolution for the EU based on S1A and S1B Synthetic Aperture Radar observations for the year 2018. Random Forest classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We assess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling >3 M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The overall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop classes and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest accuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced accuracies higher than 96%.

Accurate and timely information related to global irrigation is therefore needed to manage increasingly scarce water resources and to improve food security in the face of yield gaps, climate change and extreme events such as droughts, floods, and heat waves. Unfortunately, this information is not available for many regions of the world. This study aims to improve characterization of global rain-fed, irrigated and paddy croplands by integrating information from national and sub-national surveys, remote sensing, and gridded climate data sets. To achieve this goal, we used supervised classification of remote sensing, climate, and agricultural inventory data to generate a global map of irrigated, rain-fed, and paddy croplands. We estimate that 314 million hectares (Mha) worldwide were irrigated circa 2005. This includes 66 Mha of irrigated paddy cropland and 249 Mha of irrigated non-paddy cropland. Additionally, we estimate that 1047 Mha of cropland are managed under rain-fed conditions, including 63 Mha of rain-fed paddy cropland and 985 Mha of rain-fed non-paddy cropland. More generally, our results show that global mapping of irrigated, rain-fed, and paddy croplands is possible by combining information from multiple data sources.

The map is based on a combination of the land resource map AR50 (NIBIO) and selected data from topographical map N50 (Statens kartverk). The classification system for the ecosystem map is based on the highest hierarchical level (level 1) in Eurostat's ecosystem typology from May 2023. The map has a minimum figure size of 15 da. The Norwegian Environment Agency and NIBIO have collaborated on the development and production of main ecosystem maps for Norway, with help from NINA to assess the ecosystem links in the map. The basis for the work is, among other things, laid in the feasibility study ""Map of Norwegian main ecosystems - a feasibility study"" (NINA Report 2055), a separate concept study by the Norwegian Environment Agency and a test version (MVP) published in early summer 2023 (NIBIO Report 088/2023).","The main ecosystem map 1.0 is not the result of a separate mapping, but is produced by combining and recoding information from existing maps. These maps are designed according to different specifications than Eurostat's ecosystem typology, and the classes in the main ecosystem map in version 1.0 therefore correspond to varying degrees with the European ecosystem typology. This is made visible to some extent by adapting the Norwegian names of the classes to the actual content, but the names can still be perceived as imprecise. A thorough review of the content of the classes is described in OWNER/CONTACT PERSON NIBIO report no 143, 2023. The purpose of this product is to establish a comprehensive ecosystem map for Norway with a known methodology and an agreed typology. This first version will have shortcomings and weaknesses that will be worked on to solve in future versions. The map must contribute to the best possible knowledge base for decisions about land use, including spatial planning and business practice. The data set has been established in line with the Storting's processing of Meld.St. 14 (2015-2016) Nature for life. The data set is suitable for use in all types of planning and land management tasks, but the degree of generalization in the map means that the map is best suited on a regional scale and provides the most accurate information in the scale range 1:20000 to 1:50000. The generalization in the map corresponds to the generalization in AR50, where a rule-based automated process is used, which means that AR50 is significantly simplified and changed compared to the basic data included. (See Strand and Moum 2000 and Heggem et al. 2019 for a detailed description of the generalization methodology). NIBIO therefore recommends that AR50, and thus also this map, is mainly used for visualization of the area classes over larger areas, and not for area statistics with high demands on precision, change analyzes or for local (detailed) planning purposes.",The Norwegian Environment Agency; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO); Norwegian Institute for Nature Research,"(2023) Main ecosystems in Norway - version 1 [dataset], The Norwegian Environment Agency, available from: https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no/metadata/hovedoekosystemer-i-norge-versjon-1/ce4261f9-486d-4f28-8687-d6d0f277f667 (accessed 15/06/2024)",2023,TRUE,Norwegian Environment Agency,wms@miljodir.no,Norsk lisens for offentlige data (NLOD) 2.0,https://data.norge.no/nlod/no/2.0,NA,https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no/metadata/hovedoekosystemer-i-norge-versjon-1/ce4261f9-486d-4f28-8687-d6d0f277f667,NA,NA,FALSE,Various,Norway,TRUE,Classification scheme too broad to crosswalk to EFG level,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For the purposes of this technical note, we define “planted trees” as encompassing “planted forests,” which are defined as stands of planted trees—other than tree crops—grown for wood and wood fiber production or for ecosystem protection against wind and/or soil erosion, and “tree crops,” defined as stands of perennial trees for agricultural purposes. The objective of this technical note is to update the previously published SDPT in three areas: boundaries, to spatially differentiate planted trees on a global scale; tree species information, to help screen for the illegal exportation of timber products; and carbon sequestration rates, or removal factors, to improve maps of atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration by planted trees.

Key Findings:
Based on data compiled in SDPT version 2.0 (v2.0), in 2020 there were approximately 264 million hectares of planted forests worldwide, or 6.5 percent of total tree cover. An additional 65 million hectares were mapped as tree crops.
SDPT v2.0 planted forest area represents 90 percent of the world’s total planted forest area in 2020, as reported by FAO (2020).
Newly calculated removal factors for planted forests ranged from 0.43 to 15 metric tonnes aboveground carbon per hectare per year (t C/ha/yr), while for tree crops they ranged from 0.43 to 11 t C/ha/yr.","The online Global Forest Watch (GFW) platform has become essential to how the international community understands and interacts with geospatial forest information. While most policy frameworks and private sector commitments refer to monitoring “forests” or “natural forests,” GFW monitors global “tree cover” and “tree cover change.” “Tree cover” as identified by Hansen et al. (2013) and Potapov et al. (2022) on the GFW platform includes natural and planted forests, as well as other tree crops that are not typically considered forest. For the purposes of this technical note, we define “planted trees” as encompassing “planted forests,” which are defined as stands of planted trees—other than tree crops—grown for wood and wood fiber production or for ecosystem protection against wind and/or soil erosion, and “tree crops,” defined as stands of perennial trees for agricultural purposes.

This map represents the current extent of each Plant Community Type, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation, across all tenures in NSW. This map is updated periodically as part of the Integrated BioNet Vegetation Data program to improve quality and alignment to the NSW vegetation classification hierarchy.

The map is supplied as ESRI Feature Class (Quickview) and 5m GeoTiff Raster, and can be viewed and analysed in most commercial and open-source spatial software packages. If you prefer to use the download package, we supply an ArcGIS v10.4 mxd and/or a layer file for suggested symbology. The raster attributes contain PCT, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation.","The State Vegetation Type Map (SVTM) is a regional-scale map of the 3 levels of the NSW vegetation classification hierarchy.

It maps the distribution of each plant community type (PCT), vegetation class and vegetation formation across all tenures in New South Wales.

There are 2 separate map products.

1) The State Vegetation Type Map extant map shows the distribution of the plant community types within the limits of present-day native vegetation cover across New South Wales.
2) The State Vegetation Type Map pre-clearing map displays the likely distribution of plant community types before the loss of native vegetation cover. The pre-clearing map for central New South Wales is currently in preparation.
The State Vegetation Type Map helps government, business and the community to understand the composition and relative importance of native vegetation in their local area. It helps decision makers to better recognise the different groupings of native vegetation in their area and make more informed land management or conservation investment decisions.

By using the map, land use planning and on-ground actions are better matched to the characteristics of the vegetation being managed. For example, it facilitates selection of the best native species mix to rehabilitate disturbed areas.

The State Vegetation Type Map is created and maintained using a method for regional-scale mapping of plant community types (PCTs). The State Vegetation Type Map method can be found in the NSW State Vegetation Type Map technical notes.

The method uses on-ground surveys, aerial and satellite photograph interpretation and landscape models to map the most likely plant community types. While much of the map is regional-scale information, some fine-scale mapping has been selectively included.

We will include further fine-scale mapping in the future, as well as updates and revisions as better information becomes available. Systematic validation of the maps is progressively undertaken by independent ecologists and reported as part of the annual update.

The map's overall spatial precision (line work) is about 5 metres. Spatial precision is facilitated by computer-generated feature recognition software.

Aerial photographic interpretation is prepared between 1:10000 and 1:20000 scale.

Attribution accuracy (plant community type) depends on the number of vegetation classes being mapped and the quality and number of surveys available for each plant community type.

Some plant community types can be mapped with high accuracy, reliably representing their distribution. Others have very little survey information available, so accuracy of the map will be limited. Some plant community types have so little survey data that they cannot be mapped at a regional scale.

We are validating the State Vegetation Type Map iteratively as resources become available. Our general aim is to ensure that it averages at least 70% accuracy on the ground.","NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water","State Government of NSW and NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water 2022, NSW State Vegetation Type Map, accessed from The Sharing and Enabling Environmental Data Portal [https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/95437fbd-2ef7-44df-8579-d7a64402d42d], date accessed 2024-08-05.",2022,TRUE,NSW Government,data.broker@environment.nsw.gov.au,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,NA,https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-state-vegetation-type-map/resource/f2961f0f-517a-4066-9789-b3c852a33221,NA,NA,TRUE,Various,Regional,TRUE,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

185,mcgill_global_waterbod_2024,active,19/08/2024,Simi_Komenda,Mapping the world’s inland surface waters: an update to the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD v2),english,"In recognition of the importance of inland waters, numerous datasets mapping their extents, types, or changes have been created using sources ranging from historical wetland maps to real-time satellite remote sensing. However, differences in definitions and methods have led to spatial and typological inconsistencies among individual data sources, confounding their complementary use and integration. The Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD), published in 2004, with its globally seamless gridded depiction of major vegetated and non-vegetated wetland classes, has emerged over the last decades as a foundational reference map that has advanced research and conservation planning addressing freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem services, greenhouse gas emissions, land surface processes, hydrology, and human health. Here, we present a new iteration of this map, termed GLWD version 2, generated by harmonizing the latest ground- and satellite-based data products into one single database. Following the same design principle as its predecessor, GLWD v2 aims to avoid double-counting of overlapping surface water features while differentiating between natural and non-natural lakes, rivers of multiple sizes, and several other wetland types. The classification of GLWD v2 incorporates information on seasonality (i.e., permanent vs. intermittent vs. ephemeral); inundation vs. saturation (i.e., flooding vs. waterlogged soils); vegetation cover (e.g., forested swamps vs. non-forested marshes); salinity (e.g., salt pans); natural vs. non-natural origins (e.g., rice paddies); and a stratification of landscape position and water source (e.g., riverine, lacustrine, palustrine, coastal/marine). GLWD v2 represents 33 wetland classes and—including all intermittent classes—depicts a maximum of 18.2 million km2 of wetlands (13.4 % of the global land area excluding Antarctica). The spatial extent of each class is provided as the fractional coverage within each grid cell at a resolution of 15 arc-seconds (approximately 500 m at the equator), with cell fractions derived from input data at resolutions as small as 10 m. The updated GLWD v2 offers an improved representation of inland surface water extents and their classification for contemporary conditions.

Although considered sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic pressures, the spatial extent of peatlands is poorly constrained. We report the development of an improved global peatland map, PEATMAP, based on a meta-analysis of geospatial information collated from a variety of sources at global, regional and national levels. We estimate total global peatland area to be 4.23 million km2, approximately 2.84% of the world land area. Our results suggest that previous global peatland inventories are likely to underestimate peat extent in the tropics, and to overestimate it in parts of mid- and high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Global wetland and soil datasets are poorly suited to estimating peatland distribution. For instance, tropical peatland extents are overestimated by Global Lakes and Wetlands Database – Level 3 (GLWD-3) due to the lack of ground-truthing data; and underestimated by the use of histosols to represent peatlands in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) v1.2, as large areas of swamp forest peat in the humid tropics are omitted. PEATMAP and its underlying data are freely available as a potentially useful tool for scientists and policy makers with interests in peatlands or wetlands.

Climate Change and Ecosystem Shifts in the Southwestern United States.","Climate change shifts ecosystems, altering their compositions and instigating transitions, making climate change the predominant driver of ecosystem instability. Land management agencies experience these climatic effects on ecosystems they administer yet lack applied information to inform mitigation. We address this gap, explaining ecosystem shifts by building relationships between the historical locations of 22 ecosystems (c. 2000) and abiotic data (1970–2000; bioclimate, terrain) within the southwestern United States using ‘ensemble’ machine learning models. These relationships identify the conditions required for establishing and maintaining southwestern ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem suitability). We projected these historical relationships to mid (2041–2060) and end-of-century (2081–2100) periods using CMIP6 generation BCC-CSM2-MR and GFDL-ESM4 climate models with SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 emission scenarios. This procedure reveals how ecosystems shift, as suitability typically increases in area (~ 50% (~ 40% SD)), elevation (12–15%) and northing (4–6%) by mid-century. We illustrate where and when ecosystems shift, by mapping suitability predictions temporally and within 52,565 properties (e.g., Federal, State, Tribal). All properties had ≥ 50% changes in suitability for ≥ 1 ecosystem within them, irrespective of size (≥ 16.7 km2).

197,noaa_gom_seagrass_2011,active,26/08/2024,Charlotte_Hyndman,Gulf of Mexico Data Atlas - Submerged Aquatic Vegetation - Gulf-wide,english,"Seagrass ecosystems are among the most productive and valuable benthic habitats found in the in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico region. They support a diverse array of ecological and habitat functions, as well as various human activities along the Gulf Coast. Maintaining and improving the health of seagrass ecosystems and all coastal and marine ecosystems are essential for ensuring the ecological and economic health of the Gulf of Mexico region. Seagrass habitats provide nursery areas for extensive recreationally and commercially significant marine life by providing spawning and foraging habitat for many species of finfish, shellfish, and crustaceans. Smaller species and juveniles find protection from predation in seagrass canopy cover. Seagrasses provide food and feeding habitat for wintering waterfowl and other water birds. Seagrasses also support many threatened and endangered species, such as sea turtles, manatees, and bottlenose dolphins, which eat seagrass leaves and/or feed on smaller animals found in seagrass habitats. Epiphytes and benthic organisms attach to and colonize seagrasses, providing food for many marine animals. The extensive plant biomass of seagrass beds feeds bacteria and microscopic animals at the base of a complex food web. Seagrass roots and rhizomes form an intricately interwoven, underground mat that stabilizes the shallow bottom sediment on the seafloor, while simultaneously contributing to water clarity and decreasing wave energy by trapping sediment through waves and currents in their leaves. Trapping sediment cleanses the water from fine particles, and uptake of dissolved nutrients by seagrass will reduce the overgrowth of algae as well, thereby significantly improving water quality. Changes in seagrass habitat distribution can indicate decreased water quality and poor overall health of coastal waters. Loss of seagrass habitats can lead not only to decreased water quality, but also to increased water column turbidity, shoreline erosion, and the loss of the varied habitat functions that seagrass ecosystems provide. The many valuable functions provided by seagrass habitats support the ecosystem and contribute to economic activities. Commercial and recreational fisheries and tourism are several of the top industries in the Gulf region. These activities bring hundreds of millions of dollars into local communities and are directly influenced by the health and productivity of such marine ecosystems as seagrass habitats.",NA,Texas Parks and Wildlife Department; NOAA/NESDIS/NODC/NCDDC-National Coastal Data Development Center; U.S. Geological Survey; National Centers for Environmental Information,Handley L.

Following the international system of environmental-economic accounting framework, which recently adopts an ecosystem accounting standard. We present a novel approach to develop an ecosystem extent account from existing ecosystem classifications. This study shows the spatial and statistical extent account of 26 ecosystems (i.e. forests, grasslands, croplands, and urban, among others) between 1970 and 2015 at the national scale. Extent accounts were developed at a resolution of 25 m and provided reliable information on how ecosystem types have changed over time in Spain. Our results reflect three main patterns in the extension account: (i) an increase in forest ecosystems, (ii) a considerable decrease in agroecosystems (especially annual croplands), and (iii) substantial development of urban areas. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first attempt to develop a robust methodology to measure the extent of ecosystems at the national level. The proposed approach is crucial for a strong knowledge of ecosystem dynamics and their implications for ecosystem conditions and services at a national level.

Data represents NSW native vegetation extent, compiled from various vegetation maps using methods outlined in Simpson et al. (2011) and in Keith and Simpson (2010). 

The NSW vegetation map (version 2.2, Keith and Simpson 2006) was revised by interpreting additional candidate maps as vector layers and synthesising these into a single raster-based data set. This involved eight steps: developing a comprehensive 'standard' classification of vegetation classes for NSW; collating and standardising the projection and format of candidate source maps; assigning vegetation units of source maps to NSW vegetation classes; assessing the spatial resolution, currency and reliability of candidate source maps; assembling a composite map from candidate source maps to maximise reliability; applying a spatial mask to represent extant native vegetation; adjusting spatial resolution by dissolving small polygons and converting to 200 m raster; attributing the spatial resolution, currency and reliability of the underlying source data sets. 

The classification of 106 vegetation classes described by Keith (2004) was adopted as the framework for preparation of version 3.03 of the NSW vegetation map. Polygons from the ""Estuarine macrophytes CCA"" dataset of less than 0.1 ha were eliminated. For all other datasets polygons of less than 2 ha were eliminated. The map incorporates data from a statewide woody vegetation mask from the NSW Woody Vegetation Change Detection Program (Kitchen et al. 2010). 

The map is presented as a raster within an ESRI ArcGIS (9.3) geodatabase. Supersedes Keith and Simpson (2006), Keith (2004) and Pressey et al. (2000). Pressey et al.

However, the spatial extent of habitats, a key metric of ecosystem structure, has not been mapped in these studies. Marine reserves can provide experimental, before–after and inside–outside (control-impacted), situations for assessing the impact of fishing on ecosystems. We mapped seabed habitats and their associated communities (biotopes) in New Zealand’s oldest marine reserve for comparison with pre-reserve maps created about 30 years previously.
Areas grazed bare by sea urchins were entirely replaced in the centre of the reserve by kelp, or alga turf, an intermediate biotope between heavily grazed encrusting algae and lightly grazed kelp. Urchins declined following increased abundance and body size of spiny (rock) lobsters and fish (especially snapper) in the reserve but maintained bare rock outside. While this gradient in habitat change matched the gradient of predator abundance, it also matched the extent of reef habitat area. Thus the trophic cascade may be influenced by the effect of habitat on the abundance and behavioural interactions of urchins and their predators. Further ecosystem changes may arise should the abundance of mega-predators, such as seals, cetaceans and large sharks, increase in the region; if parasites become pathogenic; and/or when invasive species reach the reserve.
No-take marine reserves provide real-world experiments that show the importance of species in food webs, and the consequences of fishing for ecosystems. Because these changes in ecosystem structure may continue, and will vary with environment, climate and species distributions, reserves need to be permanent and replicated geographically.

Condition is a key consideration in the conservation assessment of habitats protected under the EU Habitats Directive and ecosystem condition accounts are also integral to the SEEA EA. While SEEA EA accounts have been developed at EU level for an array for ecosystem types, condition accounts remain the least developed. Collating available datasets under the SEEA EA framework, we developed extent and rudimentary condition accounts for peatland ecosystems at catchment scale in Ireland. Information relating to peatland ecosystem sub-types or habitat types was collated for peatland habitats listed under Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive, as well as degraded peatlands not included in EU nature conservation networks. While data relating to peatland condition were limited, understanding changes in ecosystem extent and incorporating knowledge of habitat types and degradation served as a proxy for ecosystem condition in the absence of more comprehensive data. This highlighted the importance of the ecosystem extent account, which underpins all other accounts in the SEEA EA framework. Reflecting findings at EU level, drainage, disturbance and land conversion were identified as the main pressures affecting peatland condition. We highlighted a number of options to gather data to build more robust, time-series extent and condition accounts for peatlands at varying accounting scales.

Creators",english,"Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense terrestrial ecosystems yet recorded. Collectively, they comprise a large but highly uncertain reservoir of the global carbon cycle, with wide-ranging estimates of their global area (441 025–1700 000 km2) and below-ground carbon storage (105–288 Pg C). Substantial gaps remain in our understanding of peatland distribution in some key regions, including most of tropical South America. Here we compile 2413 ground reference points in and around Amazonian peatlands and use them alongside a stack of remote sensing products in a random forest model to generate the first field-data-driven model of peatland distribution across the Amazon basin. Our model predicts a total Amazonian peatland extent of 251 015 km2 (95th percentile confidence interval: 128 671–373 359), greater than that of the Congo basin, but around 30% smaller than a recent model-derived estimate of peatland area across Amazonia. The model performs relatively well against point observations but spatial gaps in the ground reference dataset mean that model uncertainty remains high, particularly in parts of Brazil and Bolivia. For example, we predict significant peatland areas in northern Peru with relatively high confidence, while peatland areas in the Rio Negro basin and adjacent south-western Orinoco basin which have previously been predicted to hold Campinarana or white sand forests, are predicted with greater uncertainty. Similarly, we predict large areas of peatlands in Bolivia, surprisingly given the strong climatic seasonality found over most of the country. Very little field data exists with which to quantitatively assess the accuracy of our map in these regions. Data gaps such as these should be a high priority for new field sampling.

227,clms_eu_lcov_2018,active,26/09/2024,Simi_Komenda,CORINE Land Cover,english,"In the early 1980’s, the European Commission recognized the need for a comprehensive, detailed, and harmonized dataset on the land cover and land use of the European continent. At that time, national land cover maps were often inconsistent and incomparable across borders, making the prospect of monitoring the European environment at a continental scale all but impossible. In response, the European Commission launched the CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) program in an effort to develop a standardized methodology for producing continent-scale land cover, biotope, and air quality maps. In 1990, the first CORINE Land Cover dataset was produced. Since then, it has become a flagship component of the European Environment Agency’s Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, where it has provided essential information on European land cover/land use for over three decades.
In its current form, the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) product offers a pan-European land cover and land use inventory with 44 thematic classes, ranging from broad forested areas to individual vineyards. The product is updated with new status and change layers every six years—with the most recent update made in 2018. CLC serves a multitude of users and has nearly limitless potential and actual applications, including environmental monitoring, land use planning, climate change assessments, and emergency management.","Copernicus is the European Union's Earth Observation Programme. It offers information services based on satellite Earth observation and in situ (non-space) data. These information services are freely and openly accessible to their users through six thematic Copernicus services (atmosphere monitoring,
marine environment monitoring, land monitoring, climate change, emergency management and
security). The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) provides geographical information on land cover and its changes, land use, vegetation state, water cycle and earth surface energy variables to a broad range
of users in Europe and across the world in the field of environmental terrestrial applications. CLMS is jointly implemented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission DG Joint Research Centre (JRC). CORINE Land Cover (CLC) is the oldest and most sought-after database of CLMS. CLC was specified to standardize data collection related to land in Europe to support environmental policy development. The reference year of the first CLC inventory was 1990 (CLC1990), and the first update was created in 2000. Further inventories followed with an update cycle of 6 years. The project is implemented by
national teams under the management, guidance and close quality control of EEA. The number of participating countries has increased over time − currently includes 32 EEA member countries and the UK and six cooperating countries (EEA38 and the UK) with a total area of nearly 6 Mkm2
. Orthocorrected high spatial resolution satellite images provide the geometrical and thematic basis for mapping. In-situ data (topographic maps, ortho-photos and ground survey data) are essential ancillary information. The basic technical parameters of CLC have not changed since the beginning: 1) the nomenclature including 44 classes (on level-3) in five main land cover / use groups: Artificial surfaces, Agriculture, Forests and seminatural areas, Wetlands and Water; 2) the geometric detail: 25 hectare
minimum mapping unit (MMU) and 100 meter minimum mapping width (MMW). The layer of CORINE Land Cover Changes (CLC-Change) is produced since the second CLC inventory (CLC2000). CLC-Change is created by direct mapping of changes taking place between two consecutive inventories, based on visual image-to-image comparison of satellite images. Change mapping applies a 5 ha MMU to pick up more detail in the CLC-Change layer than in the CLC status layer. Integration of national CLC and CLCChange data includes some harmonization along national borders. European validation studies have shown that the achieved thematic accuracy is above the specified minimum (85 %). Primary CLC and
CLC-Change data are produced in vector format with polygon topology. Derived products in raster format are also available. The seamless European CLC and CLC-Change time series data (CLC1990, CLC2000, CLC2006, CLC2012, CLC2018 and related CLC-Change data) are distributed in the standard European Coordinate Reference System defined by the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) datum and Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection (EPSG: 3035). Results of the CLC inventories can be downloaded from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service site free of charge for all users for any use. CLC data contribute to a wide range of studies and applications with European coverage, e.g.: ecosystem mapping, modelling the impacts of climate change, landscape fragmentation by roads, abandonment of farmland and major structural changes in agriculture, urban sprawl, water management. A harmonization methodology has been developed to allow a statistically solid basis for CLC time series analysis by means of the so-called CLC accounting layers. The future CLC+ concept is under development, aiming the continuation of the CLC time series, by
making benefit of high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery (ESA Sentinels), thematic data
provided by Member States and advanced information extraction techniques.",Copernicus Land Monitoring Service; European Environmental Agency,Copernicus Land Monitoring Service and the European Environmental Agency (2018).

The Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla) developed a method called
multi-source national forest inventory (MS-NFI). The first operative results
were calculated in 1990. Small area forest resource estimates, in here
municipality level estimates, and estimates of variables in map form are
calculated using field data from the Finnish national forest inventory,
satellite images and other digital georeferenced data, such as topographic
database of the National Land Survey of Finland. Eleven sets of estimates have
been produced for the most part of the country until now and ten sets for
Lapland. The number of the map form themes in the most recent version, from
year 2021, is 45. In addition to the volumes by tree species and timber
assortments, the biomass by tree species groups and tree compartments have
been estimated.

The first country level estimates correspond to years 1990-1994. The most
recent versions are from years 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021.
The maps from 2021 is the seventh set of products freely available. The MTT
Agrifood Research Finland, the Finnish Forest Research Institute, the Finnish
Game and Fisheries Research Institute (RKTL) and the Information Centre of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Tike merged in 2015 to create the Natural
Resources Institute of Finland (Luke). The MS-NFI results from 2013 were the
first published by Luke. A new set of the products will be produced annually
or biannually in the future. The maps are in raster format in ETRS-TM35FIN
coordinate system. Until 2011, the pixel size was 20mx20m. In 2013 the pixel
size was changed to 16mx16m.

The products cover the combined land categories forest land, poorly productive
forest land and unproductive land. The other land categories, as well as water
bodies, have been delineated out using the elements of topographic database of
the Land Survey of Finland. This classification is independent of the
estimated themes.

4.2 Construction of the theme maps

For the 2021 products, in total 51 833 NFI field plots were used, locating
either on forest land, poorly productive forest land or unproductive land.
The satellite images used included 7 Sentinel-2A MSI images, 6 Sentinel-2B MSI
images and 6 (3 orbits) Landsat 8 OLI images. The images were from 2021.

The field data in the 2021 products were up-dated to correspond the situation
on 31 July, 2021. The length of the up-dating period was calculated for each
field plot from the date of the field measurement to the up-dating date 31
July, 2021. The start of the tree growth was supposed to be on May 1.

The relative increment of the volume of the growing stock in a forest stand
was calculated using the models by Nyyssönen and Mielikäinen (1978) for pine
(Pinus silvestris) and spruce (Picea abies). The models for pine were used for
broad-leaved trees. The volume increments were calculated by stand layers in
case of multi-layer stands. The proportions of volumes by layers were estimated 
proportionally to the quantity the basal area of the layer multiplied by the
mean height of the layer. 

Regeneration cuttings on the field plots were assessed using satellite images
and, in some cases, with aerial photographs. The stand data of the plots cut
were changed to stand data for open area plots. The final volume increments
were calibrated in such a way that the volumes by tree species on July 31,
2021, was the same as that given by the regression line estimated from field
data alone when the results seemed reasonable. Otherwise the target was
determined heuristically.

For the relative height increment, diameter increment and basal area
increment, simple fixed parameter regression models were estimated using data
from the permanent sample plots of NFI10. The models were used in a similar
way as the volume models. The biomass estimates by field plots and biomass
compartments were up-dated proportionally to the volume changes.

For a cover as complete as possible from the entire country, the 2021 product has
been completed by the data estimates from the recent years. The product thus
consists of the following sub-products:

1. The estimates from 2021, based on the NFI field data from 2017-2021 updated
   to 31.7.2021 and the satellite images from 2021 (99.45 % of
   forest pixels),
2. The estimates from 2019, based on the NFI field data from 2015-2019 updated
   to 31.7.2019 and the satellite images from 2018-2019 (0.52 % of
   forest pixels),
3. The estimates from 2019, based on the NFI field data from 2013-2017 updated
   to 31.7.2017 and the satellite images from 2017-2018 (0.02 % of
   forest pixels),
4. The estimates from 2015, based on the NFI field data from 2012-2016 updated
   to 31.7.2015 and the satellite images from 2015-2016 (0.002 % of
   forest pixels),
5. The estimates from 2013, based on the NFI field data from 2009-2013 updated
   to 31.7.2013 and the satellite images from 2012-2014 (0.0005 % of
   forest pixels).
Data source index, MS-NFI-2021, has been added to the product to indicate
the source of the estimates. The pixel values in the index image correspond to
the numbering of the previous list. The value is zero for those pixels where
no applicable estimate was found.

The map form estimates were made using the improved k-Nearest Neighbour method 
(ik-NN method). The value of five for k was used most frequently. The weights
of the features in the ik-NN method are sought using an optimization method
based on genetic algorithm. Coarse scale estimates of forest variables were
used as the supplementary data. The volumes by tree species groups were
selected as the variables. The purpose is to direct the selection of the
neighbours, on the average, to forests similar to the target pixel (see the
references below). The estimation was made separately for mineral soils, mires
and open bogs and fens. The stratification of both the satellite image and the
field plots were made using the topographic map data of Land Survey Finland.

4.3 The themes

The product consists of 44 theme maps in raster format plus data source index.
The themes can be grouped as follows:

The volume of growing stock is available as a total for all tree species 
and broken down into tree species groups (Scots pine, Norway spruce, Birch,
Other broad-leaved trees) and into timber assortments (saw timber, pulpwood).
The volume of a tree is defined as the volume of the stem wood above stump until 
the top of the tree. The volume of a tree in the field data is estimated using
the parameters measured in the field and the volume models. The unit and class
interval of the volume is 1 m3/ha in the products available for downloading.

The biomass of the growing stock has been estimated and is available by tree
species groups and by seven tree compartments. The biomass of stem and bark of
a tree is defined as the biomass of the stem above bark and above stump until
the top of the tree. The biomass of the living branches includes the biomass
of the living branches without needles or leaves. The biomass of the dead
branches includes the biomass of the dead branches possibly left in a living
tree. The foliage biomass includes the biomass of the living needles or
leaves. The biomass of stumps includes the biomass of the above and below
ground stump parts without roots. The root biomass includes the biomass of the
living roots with a diameter of at least 1 cm. The biomass of stem residual is
defined as that part of the stem biomass that can not be used as timber or
pulpwood due it size or quality. 

The biomasses of the sample trees on a NFI field plot are calculated from the
living sample trees belonging to a plot using the wood density models (Repola
et al. 2007) and biomass models (Repola 2008, 2009). The biomasses of the
trees called tally trees are estimated using the estimates of the sample trees
(with more parameters measured) and the parameters of tally trees and
stands. The unit of the biomass in the maps available for downloading is 10 kg/ha. 

The basal area of the growing stock on a forest stand is the cross section area
of the tree stems of a stand per hectare and measured at a height of 1.3 m.
The basal area is measured in the field for the field plot stands on forest land
and poorly productive forest land in the classes of 1 m2/ha.

The age of the growing stock on a forest stand is the weighted average of the
trees, the basal area of the tree as the weight. The age is assessed in the field
for the field plot stands on forest land and poorly productive forest land in
the classes of one year. 

The mean height of the trees on a forest stand is the height of the basal
area median tree for the development classes young thinning stand or more
mature stands. It is about the same as the basal area weighted average
height. For seedling stands, the mean height is the average height of the
dominant and co-dominant seedlings. The mean height is assessed in the field
in the classes of 1 dm.

The mean diameter of trees is assessed at a height of 1.3 metres and is the
the diameter of the basal area median tree. It is about the same as the
weighted average diameter, the basal area of a tree as the weight. It is
assessed for the field plot stands on forest land and poorly productive forest
land in the classes of 1 cm.

The canopy cover of trees is the vertical projection area on the horizontal
plane of the canopies of the individual trees on a field plot (without double
counting the overlapping canopies). In NFI10, it was assessed in the field as
a shares (0-99%) on a fixed radius plot. For the NFI11 plots, it was estimated
using k-NN method and the NFI10 plot data. In North Lapland in NFI9, the
canopy cover was assessed in three categories if the plot was either on forest
land, poorly productive forest land or unproductive land. A regression model
was constructed to estimate the cover in the classes of one percent. 

The canopy cover proportion of broad-leaved trees is derived from the total
cover using the basal area. However, in the seedling stands, the canopy cover
of broad-leaved trees is assessed using the shares of the stem numbers.

The theme ""Land class"" divides forestry land into three sub-categories, forest
land (pixel value 1), poorly productive forest land (2), unproductive land (3).

The theme ""Land Class based on FAO FRA"" divides forest into four sub-categories
forest (pixel value 1), other wooded land (2), other land (3) and other land
with tree cover (4), based on the definition of the United Nations FAO Global
Forest Resource Assessment (FRA).

The theme ""Site main class"" divides forest land, poorly productive forest land
and unproductive land into mineral soil (pixel value 1) and peatland site
classes. The peatland site class is sub-divided into three categories spruce
mires (2), pine mires (3) and treeless peatland (4, open bogs and fens). A
site is classified as peatland if the organic layer is peat, or if more than
75% of the ground vegetation is peatland vegetation. Otherwise, the site is
mineral soil. Both the field plots and satellite images are stratified prior
the analyses into three strata, 1) mineral soil, 2) pine and spruce mires, 3)
treeless peatland using the topographic map data. Thus in the products,
each NFI field data based category can occur within each map based stratum.

The site fertility classes are used for grouping the forest by vegetation
zones into uniform classes according to their site fertility and wood
production capacity. In national land-use classification, all stands on
mineral soil with site fertility class in 1 - 6 were classified as forest land
(1 is herb rich sites, 2 is herb rich heath forests, 3 is mesic forests, 4 is
sub-xeric forests, 5 is xeric forests, 6 is barren forests). Class 7 (rocky
and sandy soils and alluvial lands) can be forest land, poorly productive
forest land, or unproductive land, and class 8 (summit and fjeld land with
single coniferous trees) either poorly productive forest land or unproductive
land. Classes 9 (mountain birch dominated fjelds) and 10 (Open fjelds) are
poorly productive forest land or unproductive land. Both natural and drained
peatlands are classified into six site fertility classes independently of the
land class. Class 1 includes euthropic mines and fens, 2 mesothropic mires and
fens, 3 meso-oligothropic mires, 4 oligothropic mires, 5 oligo-ombothropic
mires and 6 Sphagnum fuscum dominated mires. Both the field plots and
satellite images are stratified prior the analyses into three strata, mineral
soil, pine mires and spruce mires, treeless peatland . The site fertility
class is estimated for each pixel as the most likely site fertility
class. Thus in the products, each NFI field data based category can occur
within each map based stratum.",Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Natural Resources Institute Finland (2021), The Multi-source National Forest Inventory Raster Maps of 2021.",2021,FALSE,Tytti Kontula,tytti.kontula@syke.fi,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,kp1_6_vmi21.aux.zip,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,Various,Finland,TRUE,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These ecosystems comprise brackish, shallow water with salt-tolerant plants such as herbs, grasses and shrubs, and are commonly found at temperate and high latitudes. Saltmarshes are of ecological importance as they underpin the estuarine food web. In particular, saltmarshes serve as nesting, nursery and feeding grounds for numerous species of birds, fish, molluscs and crustaceans, including commercially important fish species such as herring (Clupea harengus), and are also home to a number of Endangered and Critically Endangered species.

The regions aim to capture generic patterns of biodiversity across habitats and taxa, with regions extending from the coast (intertidal zone) to the 200 m depth contour (extended beyond these waters out by a 5 km buffer).

The PPOW dataset shows a biogeographic classification of the surface pelagic (i.e. epipelagic) waters of the world’s oceans.

(2024) within the scope of the Global Pasture Wath initiative. The mapped grassland extent includes any land cover type, which contains at least 30% of dry or wet low vegetation, dominated by grasses and forbs (less than 3 meters) and a:

maximum of 50% tree canopy cover (greater than 5 meters),
maximum of 70% of other woody vegetation (scrubs and open shrubland), and
maximum of 50% active cropland cover in mosaic landscapes of cropland & other vegetation.
The grassland extent is classified into two classes:

Cultivated grassland: Areas where grasses and other forage plants have been intentionally planted and managed, as well as areas of native grassland-type vegetation where they clearly exhibit active and 'heavy' management for specific human-directed uses, such as directed grazing of livestock.
Natural/semi-natural grassland: Relatively undisturbed native grasslands/short-height vegetation, such as steppes and tundra, as well as areas that have experienced varying degrees of human activity in the past, which may contain a mix of native and introduced species due to historical land use and natural processes. In general, they exhibit natural-looking patterns of varied vegetation and clearly ordered hydrological relationships throughout the landscape.
The dataset is organized in 69 global mosaics (23 years for each time series) in COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) format, WGS84 Coordinate Systems (EPSG:4326) and pixel size equal to 0.00025 degrees, including:

Probabilities of cultivated grassland (values range from 0–100),

Remote sensing provides a powerful resource of fundamental data at different spatial resolutions and spectral regions, making it an essential tool for vegetation mapping and biomass management. Due to the ever-increasing availability of free data and software, satellites have been predominantly used to map, analyze, and monitor natural resources for conservation purposes. This study aimed to map vegetation from Sentinel-2 (S2) data in a complex and mixed vegetation cover of the Lousã district in Portugal. We used ten multispectral bands with a spatial resolution of 10 m, and four vegetation indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). After applying principal component analysis (PCA) on the 10 S2A bands, four texture features, including mean (ME), homogeneity (HO), correlation (CO), and entropy (EN), were derived for the first three principal components. Textures were obtained using the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM). As a result, 26 independent variables were extracted from S2. After defining the land use classes using an object-based approach, the Random Forest (RF) classifier was applied. The map accuracy was evaluated by the confusion matrix, using the metrics of overall accuracy (OA), producer accuracy (PA), user accuracy (UA), and kappa coefficient (Kappa). The described classification methodology showed a high OA of 90.5% and kappa of 89% for vegetation mapping. Using GLCM texture features and vegetation indices increased the accuracy by up to 2%; however, classification using GLCM texture features and spectral bands achieved the highest OA (92%), indicating the texture features′ capability in detecting the variability of forest species at stand level. The ME and CO showed the highest contribution to the classification accuracy among the GLCM textures. GNDVI outperformed other vegetation indices in variable importance. Moreover, using only S2A spectral bands, especially bands 11, 12, and 2, showed a high potential to classify the map with an OA of 88%. This study showed that adding at least one GLCM texture feature and at least one vegetation index into the S2A spectral bands may effectively increase the accuracy metrics and tree species discrimination.",NA,University of Coimbra; Universidad de Alcala,"Mohammadpour, P., Viegas, D.

However, the higher spatial resolution makes it more laborious to collect training samples for efficient land-cover product updating. Fortunately, the existing historical products with a lower spatial resolution can be used as labels to achieve cross-resolution mapping with the latest images of a higher resolution. Although cross-resolution mapping can generate a large number of low-cost training labels, the labels can be noisy due to resolution mismatch or semantic errors. Furthermore, the existing deep learning based classification models have difficulty in maintaining the output resolution. In this article, a cross-resolution land-cover mapping framework with noisy label learning is proposed to complete high-resolution land-cover mapping based on noisy lower-resolution labels. The proposed method contains three parts: 1) To solve the resolution mismatch problem, the training labels are refined by modeling the spectral similarity and the spatial adjacency between the labels and the images using a conditional random field model. 2) To avoid the problem of resolution loss with the deep fully convolutional neural networks, a high-resolution deep semantic segmentation network is proposed to achieve deep feature extraction while maintaining the output resolution. 3) To eliminate the influence of semantic errors in the generated labels, a class-conditional label correction method is proposed, which detects and corrects the abnormal incorrect labels to facilitate network training. A national-scale land-cover mapping experiment for China was carried out.

Peat soils are formed by the build-up of partially decomposed organic matter under waterlogged anoxic conditions. Most peat is found in cool climatic regions where unimpeded decomposition is slower, but deposits are also found under some tropical swamp forests. Here we present field measurements from one of the world's most extensive regions of swamp forest, the Cuvette Centrale depression in the central Congo Basin. We find extensive peat deposits beneath the swamp forest vegetation (peat defined as material with an organic matter content of at least 65 per cent to a depth of at least 0.3 metres). Radiocarbon dates indicate that peat began accumulating from about 10,600 years ago, coincident with the onset of more humid conditions in central Africa at the beginning of the Holocene. The peatlands occupy large interfluvial basins, and seem to be largely rain-fed and ombrotrophic-like (of low nutrient status) systems. Although the peat layer is relatively shallow (with a maximum depth of 5.9 metres and a median depth of 2.0 metres), by combining in situ and remotely sensed data, we estimate the area of peat to be approximately 145,500 square kilometres (95 per cent confidence interval of 131,900-156,400 square kilometres), making the Cuvette Centrale the most extensive peatland complex in the tropics. This area is more than five times the maximum possible area reported for the Congo Basin in a recent synthesis of pantropical peat extent. We estimate that the peatlands store approximately 30.6 petagrams (30.6 × 10(15) grams) of carbon belowground (95 per cent confidence interval of 6.3-46.8 petagrams of carbon)-a quantity that is similar to the above-ground carbon stocks of the tropical forests of the entire Congo Basin. Our result for the Cuvette Centrale increases the best estimate of global tropical peatland carbon stocks by 36 per cent, to 104.7 petagrams of carbon (minimum estimate of 69.6 petagrams of carbon; maximum estimate of 129.8 petagrams of carbon).

The only recent available country-wide LC map of Iran was generated in 2016 by the Iranian Space Agency (ISA) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with a considerably low accuracy. Therefore, the production of an up-to-date and accurate Iran-wide LC map using the most recent remote sensing, machine learning, and big data processing algorithms is required. Moreover, it is important to develop an efficient method for automatic LC generation for various time periods without the need to collect additional ground truth data from this immense country. Therefore, this study was conducted to fulfill two objectives. First, an improved Iranian LC map with 13 LC classes and a spatial resolution of 10 m was produced using multi-temporal synergy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite datasets applied to an object-based Random forest (RF) algorithm. For this purpose, 2,869 Sentinel-1 and 11,994 Sentinel-2 scenes acquired in 2017 were processed and classified within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform allowing big geospatial data analysis. The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) of the final Iran-wide LC map for 2017 was 95.6% and 0.95, respectively, indicating the considerable potential of the proposed big data processing method. Second, an efficient automatic method was developed based on Sentinel-2 images to migrate ground truth samples from a reference year to automatically generate an LC map for any target year. The OA and KC for the LC map produced for the target year 2019 were 91.35% and 0.91, respectively, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method for automatic LC mapping.

The first map presents ecosystems at a level that is consistent with Levels 5 or 6 of the Global Ecosystem Typology (South African National Biodiversity Institute (2006- ). The Vegetation Map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, Mucina, L., Rutherford, M.C. and Powrie, L.W. (Editors), Online, https://bgis.sanbi.org/Projects/Detail/2258, Version 2024.). The South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) has cross referenced these ecosystems to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystems Typology. The result is a map of ecosystem functional groups at Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. 

The second layer contains spatial information on anthropogenic or human-modified terrestrial ecosystems, the European Space Agency’s WorldCover global landcover dataset.The ten landcover classes were cross-referenced to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. Of note, tree- and shrub-covered landscapes identified from landcover are reassigned to the underlying ecosystem functional group. This is because even if these ecosystems are covered by woody vegetation, they retain the same predominant ecological drivers of the underlying ecosystem (i.e. herbivory, fires, frost, seasonal precipitation). Similarly, bare ground is considered as degraded versions of the underlying ecosystems, rather than a distinct ecosystem functional group. Because the WorldCover dataset does not distinguish between natural and artificially planted tree cover, we extracted plantation data from the European Commission Joint Research Centre’s Global Map of Forest Types. Based on this, landcover and plantation information can be combined to identify human-modified ecosystem functional groups. 

The third layer contains spatial information on the distribution of freshwater ecosystems. For dams (Lehner, B., Beames, P., Mulligan, M. et al. (2024). The Global Dam Watch database of river barrier and reservoir information for large-scale applications. Sci Data 11, 1069), we distinguished between two ecosystem functional groups depending on the depth of the waterbody. Dams that were deeper than 15 m were classified as F3.1 Large Reservoirs. Dams shallower than 15m were classified as F3.2 Constructed Lacustrine Wetlands. For rivers (Resource Quality Services (was IWQS) and Chief Directorate of National GeoSpatial Information (was Surveys and Mapping) (2012) Rivers of South Africa. Department of Water Affair, Pretoria, South Africa), permanent or perennial rivers were classified as F1.1. Permanent upland streams.

The current study aims at improving knowledge on the types of terrestrial ecosystems present in Seychelles, their geographical distribution and their state of conservation, as a basis for the study of biodiversity and conservation patterns integrating species and ecosystem levels. A conceptual framework is presented (p.6-33) which integrates habitat-types within levels of organization of biodiversity and through different time scales. This allows to define types of ecosystems and to study their dynamics (especially their biotic variability) at a global scale (across continents, i.e. chorology) and through time (chronology). Terminology is reviewed according to international standards, with several improvements. Cartographic outputs are based on the concept of hierarchical mapping, i.e. where several thematic maps can be combined in different ways in order to produce different outputs according to specific needs. These thematic maps are produced based on a combination of methods, including modelling, field data, visual interpretation and supervised classification of remotely sensed images, and other GIS processes. The main output is a map of habitat-types which presents 31 classes (Figure 22, p.58). That map models the main environmental constraints (limiting factors) to which species have to adapt (even exotic species). Several other thematic maps allow assessing the conservation state of these habitat-types based on the current vegetation physiognomy, ecosystem development stage and naturalness. Finally, a simplified map of land cover types is proposed based on a combination of these thematic maps, or factors, and constitutes the second most important map result (Figure 24b, p. 62). Maps for all islands are provided in Annex 2. Ecosystem richness is the highest on Mahé and Silhouette, the former being also the most impacted by humans (8% natural) while the latter is the least impacted (51% natural). Naturalness is increasing with elevation: 9% in lowland, 19% in submontane, 46% in lower montane and 96% in tree fern lower montane belts (Table 10). Most of the coastal habitat-types have almost completely been transformed. The total current forest cover is estimated to ca. 10126 ha for the 5 islands (Annex 3). Anthropic lands cover ca. 6526 ha. Highly degraded bare soils represent 130 ha, mostly on Praslin (90 ha) and Curieuse (36 ha) (Table 10, p.67).

The dataset comes from an inventory conducted in 30 fragments of Myrtaceae swamp forest, located in an agroforestry matrix landscape of the coastal La Araucanía Region in Chile. The data collection was carried out using line transect sampling, which was traced through the core of each fragment orientated towards its longest axis. The dataset provides a record of 55 species (24 trees, 1 vine [as a host], 16 herbs and 15 shrubs) including accidental epiphytes (n = 7), hemiparasites (n = 4), host (n = 10) and additionally woody debris (n = 36). The most frequent trees in the landscape were Myrceugenia exsucca (n = 36 records) and Blepharocalyx cruckshanksii (n = 33 records), species that were also the most common hosts. Drimys winteri was a companion species, other trees and shrubs generally being rarely observed, as was the case of the introduced species (Prunus avium, Rubus constrictus and Ulex europaeus). Branches were the most common microhabitat for hemiparasites. Within this group, Lepidoceras chilense was the most frequent species. For accidental epiphytes, Drimys winteri, which commonly grows on the ground (soil), were the most common species found in the main trunk crotch. Some unusual observations were the climber Cissus striata as host of Tristerix corymbosus (hemiparasite) and Tristerix corymbosus as host of Lepidoceras chilense (hemiparasite).","This study represents a landscape-scale sample of the swamp forest, which is distributed in a dispersed pattern over a large stretch of Chile. The data were collected from 30 forest patches (from 0.05 to 936 ha), located on the coast of the Araucanía. The database includes the presence of 55 species of vascular plants in 356 records. The main novelty of this contribution is the systematic classification of species under six traits, never before reported in the same database: (i) condition (coarse woody debris, fallen log, live, snag), (ii) habit (herb, shrub, tree), (iii) growth microhabitat (e.g. tree trunk, branch, main trunk crotch), (iv) growth form (accidental epiphyte, hemiparasite, terricolous, vegetative), (v) host species (as appropriate) and (vi) relative location of the species in the sampled patch and surrounding areas (core, border, matrix). Species not previously observed in these forests were: Gavilea spp., Hieracium spp., Lophosoria quadripinnata, Berberis actinacantha, Gaultheria phillyreifolia, Ovidia pillo-pillo, Amomyrtus meli and Caldcluvia paniculata. In addition, two introduced species are novelties for the catalogue of vascular plants of Chile (Cupressus macrocarpa and Prunus avium). Several of these ecosystem traits are indeed new reports for these types of forests (e.g. accidental epiphytes, fallen logs, species-host relationship); at the same time, more frequent data (i.e. species composition, habit) are found in different contributions, making the comprehensive process of analysis difficult.",Universidad Católica de Temuco,"Pincheira-Ulbrich J, Andrade Mansilla E, Peña-Cortés F, Vergara Fernández C.

Our knowledge of the distribution of these habitats is largely incomplete, particularly in deeper water and at higher latitudes. The western continental shelf of Greenland is one example of a deep (more than 500 m) Arctic region with limited information available. This study uses an adaptation of the EUNIS seabed classification scheme to document benthic habitats in the region of the West Greenland shrimp trawl fishery from 60°N to 72°N in depths of 61–725 m. More than 2000 images collected at 224 stations between 2011 and 2015 were grouped into 7 habitat classes. A classification model was developed using environmental proxies to make habitat predictions for the entire western shelf (200–700 m below 72°N). The spatial distribution of habitats correlates with temperature and latitude. Muddy sediments appear in northern and colder areas whereas sandy and rocky areas dominate in the south. Southern regions are also warmer and have stronger currents. The Mud habitat is the most widespread, covering around a third of the study area. There is a general pattern that deep channels and basins are dominated by muddy sediments, many of which are fed by glacial sedimentation and outlets from fjords, while shallow banks and shelf have a mix of more complex habitats.

The spatial base of the NCSCD is a polygon database describing soils in the northern circumpolar permafrost regions. The database was compiled by combining and homogenizing several regional/national soil maps. To calculate storage of soil organic carbon, these soil maps have been linked to field-data on soil organic carbon storage from a total of 1,647 sites from around the circumpolar permafrost region. The NCSCD contains information on fractions of coverage of different soil types (following U.S. Soil Taxonomy nomenclature) as well as storage of soil organic carbon (kg/m2) between 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm depth. The NCSCD is available either as a polygon-based database (which is the original format) or converted to gridded data. Gridded data products are available in different spatial grid resolutions and in formats adapted for use in desktop GIS-applications and model applications.","High-latitude terrestrial ecosystems are key components in the global carbon (C) cycle. Estimates of global soil organic carbon (SOC), however, do not include updated estimates of SOC storage in permafrost-affected soils or representation of the unique pedogenic processes that affect these soils. The Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) was developed to quantify the SOC stocks in the circumpolar permafrost region (18.7 × 106 km2). The NCSCD is a polygon-based digital database compiled from harmonized regional soil classification maps in which data on soil order coverage have been linked to pedon data (n = 1778) from the northern permafrost regions to calculate SOC content and mass. In addition, new gridded datasets at different spatial resolutions have been generated to facilitate research applications using the NCSCD (standard raster formats for use in geographic information systems and Network Common Data Form files common for applications in numerical models). This paper describes the compilation of the NCSCD spatial framework, the soil sampling and soil analytical procedures used to derive SOC content in pedons from North America and Eurasia and the formatting of the digital files that are available online.

In this study, we used support vector machines (SVM) for modeling rare species distribution and we compared it to another emerging machine learning classifier called random forests (RF). The comparison was performed using three native and endemic plants found at low- to mid-elevation in the island of Moorea (French Polynesia, South Pacific) and considered rare because of scarce occurrence records: Lepinia taitensis (28 observed occurrences), Pouteria tahitensis (20 occurrences) and Santalum insulare var. raiateense (81 occurrences). We selected a set of biophysical variables to describe plant habitats in tropical high volcanic islands, including topographic descriptors and an overstory vegetation map. The former were extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) and the latter is a result of a SVM classification of spectral and textural bands from very high resolution Quickbird satellite imagery. Our results show that SVM slightly but constantly outperforms RF in predicting the distribution of rare species based on the kappa coefficient and the area under the curve (AUC) achieved by both classifiers. The predicted potential habitats of the three rare species are considerably wider than their currently observed distribution ranges. We hypothesize that the causes of this discrepancy are strong anthropogenic disturbances that have impacted low- to mid-elevation forests in the past and present.

However, they have been destroyed by many natural and anthropogenic factors in recent years. One of the main destructive factors of forests in these ecosystems is the establishment of Invasive Plant Species (IPS). This study aims to map the forest area and Acacia sp. distribution (as the main IPS) in Cíes Islands in northwestern Spain using high resolution satellite images, and machine learning methods in time series. For this purpose, PlanetScope satellite images of the study area were obtained for June of 2016, 2020, and 2024. In addition, some data of location of tree species in forest cover and distribution of Acacia sp. were collected during fieldworks to use them as ground truth data. Four machine learning algorithms (RF, SVM, DT, and ANN) were used to separate the forest cover in time series. Results showed that Random Forest (RF) algorithm was the most accurate method to classify forest cover in the study area (for 2016, OA: 89.16 %, : 0.86; for 2020, OA: 93.33 %, : 0.91; for 2024, OA: 95.83 %, : 0.93).

Despite their importance, anthropogenic activities are rapidly degrading and deforesting mangroves world-wide. Madagascar contains 2% of the world’s mangroves, many of which have undergone or are starting to exhibit signs of widespread degradation and deforestation. Remotely sensed data can be used to quantify mangrove loss and characterize remaining distributions, providing detailed, accurate, timely and updateable information. We use USGS maps produced from Landsat data to calculate nation-wide dynamics for Madagascar’s mangroves from 1990 to 2010, and examine change more closely by partitioning the national distribution in to primary (i.e., >1000 ha) ecosystems; with focus on four Areas of Interest (AOIs): Ambaro-Ambanja Bays (AAB), Mahajamba Bay (MHJ), Tsiribihina Manombolo Delta (TMD) and Bay des Assassins (BdA). Results indicate a nation–wide net-loss of 21% (i.e., 57,359 ha) from 1990 to 2010, with dynamics varying considerably among primary mangrove ecosystems. Given the limitations of national-level maps for certain localized applications (e.g., carbon stock inventories), building on two previous studies for AAB and MHJ, we employ Landsat data to produce detailed, contemporary mangrove maps for TMD and BdA.

However, such rapid and disordered expansion posed risks to coastal environment, economic development, and biodiversity protection. This study aimed to produce an accurate national-scale marine aquaculture map at a spatial resolution of 16 m, using a proposed model based on deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) and applied it to satellite data from China's GF-1 sensor in an end-to-end way. The analyses used homogeneous CNNs to extract high-dimensional features from the input imagery and preserve information at full resolution. Then, a hierarchical cascade architecture was followed to capture multi-scale features and contextual information. This hierarchical cascade homogeneous neural network (HCHNet) was found to achieve better classification performance than current state-of-the-art models (FCN-32s, Deeplab V2, U-Net, and HCNet). The resulting marine aquaculture area map has an overall classification accuracy > 95 % (95.2 %–96.4, 95 % confidence interval). And marine aquaculture was found to cover a total area of ∼ 1100 km2 (1096.8–1110.6 km2, 95 % confidence interval) in China, of which more than 85 % is marine plant culture areas, with 87 % found in the Fujian, Shandong, Liaoning, and Jiangsu provinces.

However, the potential of GEE for forest resource management has not been fully exploited. To extract dominant woody plant species, GEE combined Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data with the addition of the National Forest Resources Inventory (NFRI) and topographic data, resulting in a 10 m resolution multimodal geospatial dataset for subtropical forests in southeast China. Spectral and texture features, red-edge bands, and vegetation indices of S1 and S2 data were computed. A hierarchical model obtained information on forest distribution and area and the dominant woody plant species. The results suggest that combining data sources from the S1 winter and S2 yearly ranges enhances accuracy in forest distribution and area extraction compared to using either data source independently. Similarly, for dominant woody species recognition, using S1 winter and S2 data across all four seasons was accurate. Including terrain factors and removing spatial correlation from NFRI sample points further improved the recognition accuracy. The optimal forest extraction achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 97.4% and a map-level image classification efficacy (MICE) of 96.7%. OA and MICE were 83.6% and 80.7% for dominant species extraction, respectively.

The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge’s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps).

Despite the increasing availability of such data at regional and national scales, the average ecologist has been limited in accessing them due to high requirements on computing power and remote sensing knowledge. We processed Denmark's publicly available national airborne laser scanning (ALS) data set acquired in 2014/15, together with the accompanying elevation model, to compute 70 rasterised descriptors of interest for ecological studies. With a grain size of 10 m, these data products provide a snapshot of high-resolution measures including vegetation height, structure and density, as well as topographic descriptors including elevation, aspect, slope and wetness across more than 40 000 km2 covering almost all of Denmark's terrestrial surface. The resulting data set is comparatively small (∼94 GB, compressed 16.8 GB), and the raster data can be readily integrated into analytical workflows in software familiar to many ecologists (GIS software, R, Python). Source code and documentation for the processing workflow are openly available via a code repository, allowing for transfer to other ALS data sets, as well as modification or re-calculation of future instances of Denmark's national ALS data set. We hope that our high-resolution ecological vegetation and terrain descriptors (EcoDes-DK15) will serve as an inspiration for the publication of further such data sets covering other countries and regions and that our rasterised data set will provide a baseline of the ecosystem structure for current and future studies of biodiversity, within Denmark and beyond.

Consequently, identifying their locations and extents is imperative. The stability, repeatability, cost-effectiveness, multi-scale coverage, and proper spatial resolution imagery of satellites provide a valuable opportunity for their use in various large-scale applications, such as provincial wetland mapping. To do so, it is required to (1) process and classify big geo data (i.e. a large amount of satellite datasets) in a time- and computationally-efficient approach and (2) collect a large amount of field samples. In this study, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning algorithms were utilized to process thousands of remote sensing images and produce provincial wetland inventory maps of the three Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). Additionally, using GEE, a generalized supervised classification method is proposed to produce a regional wetland map from a large area (e.g., a province) when lacking field samples. In fact, using the field data from only Manitoba and assuming that all wetlands in Canada have similar characteristics, the wetland maps were generated for the other two provinces. The overall classification accuracies for Manitoba, Quebec, and NL were 84%, 78%, and 82%, respectively, indicating the high potential of the proposed method for aiding provincial wetland inventory systems.",NA,Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation of Natural Resources Canada (NRCan),"Amani, M., Brisco, B., Afshar, M., Mirmazloumi, S.

285,wuhan_tibet_lcov_2024,active,17/04/2025,Tess_Harmer,A dataset of land cover samples over the Tibetan Plateau,english,"The Tibetan Plateau (TP) hosts a variety of vegetation types, ranging from broadleaved and needle-leaved forests at the lower altitudes and in mesic areas to alpine grassland at the higher altitudes and in xeric areas. Accurate and detailed mapping of the vegetation distribution on the TP is essential for an improved understanding of climate change effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, existing land cover datasets for the TP are either provided at a low spatial resolution or have insufficient vegetation types to characterize certain unique TP ecosystems, such as the alpine scree. Here, we produced a 10 m resolution TP land cover map with 12 vegetation classes and 3 non-vegetation classes for the year 2022 (referred to as TP_LC10-2022) by leveraging state-of-the-art remote-sensing approaches including Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, environmental and topographic datasets, and four machine learning models using the Google Earth Engine platform. Our TP_LC10-2022 dataset achieved an overall classification accuracy of 86.5 % with a kappa coefficient of 0.854. Upon comparing it with four existing global land cover products, TP_LC10-2022 showed significant improvements in terms of reflecting local-scale vertical variations in the southeast TP region. Moreover, we found that alpine scree, which is ignored in existing land cover datasets, occupied 13.99 % of the TP region, and shrublands, which are characterized by distinct forms (deciduous shrublands and evergreen shrublands) that are largely determined by the topography and are missed in existing land cover datasets, occupied 4.63 % of the TP region. Our dataset provides a solid foundation for further analyses which need accurate delineation of these unique vegetation types in the TP.

Land-cover classification maps of the Arctic regions are essential for monitoring and change detection purposes, as well as upscaling of various ecosystem processes. However, large-scale land cover maps of the Arctic regions are often too coarse to properly capture the heterogeneity of these landscapes. In this study, we bridge this gap through incorporating multi temporal Landsat-8 OLI data in a large-scale land cover classification, and subsequently produce a tundra classification map for the entire Greenland. An algorithm is developed that allows for the extraction of vegetation phenology from single-year time series of 4169 OLI scenes at 30 m resolution despite the low revisit frequency of the satellite and persistent cloud cover. The phenological metrics, satellite-derived wetness, and terrain information are then used to separate land surface classes using a random forest classifier. The optimal algorithm parameters and input layers are identified, ultimately yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 89.25% across the studied area. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis on the resulting land-cover map and for the first time presented the geographical distribution, latitudinal gradients, and climate linkages of the various tundra vegetation classes across the ice-free part of Greenland.

Conservation and restoration of native vegetation is essential and could be facilitated by detailed landcover maps. Here, across a large case study region in Goiás State, Brazil (1.1 Mha), we produced physiognomy level maps of native vegetation (n = 8) and other landcover types (n = 5). Seven different classification schemes using different combinations of input satellite imagery were used, with a Random Forest classifier and 2-stage approach implemented within Google Earth Engine. Overall classification accuracies ranged from 88.6–92.6% for native and non-native vegetation at the formation level (stage-1), and 70.7–77.9% for native vegetation at the physiognomy level (stage-2), across the seven different classifications schemes. The differences in classification accuracy resulting from varying the input imagery combination and quality control procedures used were small. However, a combination of seasonal Sentinel-1 (C-band synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (surface reflectance) imagery resulted in the most accurate classification at a spatial resolution of 20 m. Classification accuracies when using Landsat-8 imagery were marginally lower, but still reasonable. Quality control procedures that account for vegetation burning when selecting vegetation reference data may also improve classification accuracy for some native vegetation types.

Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) enables all-day and all-weather observations of rice distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. The complexity of rice cultivation patterns in tropical and subtropical regions makes it difficult to construct a representative data-relevant rice crop model, increasing the difficulty in extracting rice distributions from SAR data. To address this problem, a rice area mapping method for large regional tropical or subtropical areas based on time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data is proposed in this study. Based on the analysis of rice backscattering characteristics in mainland Southeast Asia, the combination of spatiotemporal statistical features with good generalization ability was selected and then input into the U-Net semantic segmentation model, combined with WorldCover data to reduce false alarms, finally the 20 m resolution rice area map of five countries in mainland Southeast Asia in 2019 was obtained. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 92.20 % on the validation sample set, and the good agreement was obtained when comparing our rice area map with statistical data and other rice area maps at the national and provincial levels. The maximum coefficient of determination R2 was 0.93 at the national level and 0.97 at the provincial level. These results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in rice area mapping with complex cropping patterns and the reliability of the generated rice area maps.

This is the case for East African countries such as Rwanda, where agricultural expansion into wetlands and agricultural intensification are crucial elements of the government's strategy to increase food production and decrease dependence from global food markets. However, spatially explicit information of the location and status of wetlands for informed decision making is lacking or not up to date. In the related research article, we therefore develop a framework comprising the following spatial layers: Delineation, Surface Water Occurrence (SWO), Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification and Wetland Use Intensity (WUI). These layers are based on satellite imagery from the European Copernicus Programme and cover the whole of Rwanda. The Delineation is derived from a static Potential Wetlands layer and Sentinel-2 imagery using object-based image analysis (OBIA). The SWO is a per-pixel count of the times a location was detected as flooded using Sentinel-1 imagery. For the LULC classification, an object-based decision tree classifier is applied to Sentinel-2 imagery in Combination with the Delineation layer and the SWO. The WUI layer is based on the Absolute Mean Spectral Dynamics indicator depicting pixel-wise changes in reflectance values in Sentinel-2 bands relevant for wetland vegetation and hydrological dynamics. All layers refer to the year 2017, except for the SWO layer, which covers surface water dynamics from 2014 to 2017. The layers can be used individually or in combination and thus adapted to the different information needs for sustainable wetland management.","This dataset contains the Potential Wetlands map based on topographic indices, the Wetland Delineation derived from it, the Surface Water Occurrence layer, the Land Use/Land Cover map, and the Wetland Use Intensity layer.

The annual cycle of formation, growth, decay and clearance of river ice can include low flows and ice jams, as well as mid-winter and spring break-up events. Reports and associated data on river ice occurrence are often limited to site and season specific studies. Within Canada, the National Hydrometric Program (NHP) operates a network of gauging stations with water level as the primary measured variable. It is well known by the hydrologic community that river ice related information can be extracted from water level records. Near two decades ago, the Water Science and Technology Directorate of Environment and Climate Change Canada initiated a long-term effort to compile, archive and extract river ice related information from hydrometric records. As a result, this work has delivered an original research data set: the Canadian River Ice Database (CRID). The CRID includes near 71,000 river ice variables from a network of 196 NHP sites throughout Canada in operation within the period 1894 to 2015. The task of compiling this database involved manual extraction, data entry and input of more than 460,000 information fields on water level, discharge, date, time and data quality rating. In excess of 100,000 paper and digital files were reviewed with the network representing over 10,000 station years of active operation. This database follows up on several earlier efforts to compile information on river ice and expands the scope and detail for use in Canadian river ice research and applications. At each location, time series of up to 15 river ice variables specific to occurrence of freeze-up and winter-low events, occurrence of mid-winter break-up, ice thickness, spring break-up and maximum open-water level is compiled.

Southeast Asia is an area of high species richness and endemicity under considerable anthropogenic threat with, unfortunately, scant focus on its lowland forests. We estimated extent of lowland forest loss from 1998 to 2018, including inside protected areas and determined the vulnerability of this remaining forest. Maximum likelihood classification techniques were used to classify Landsat images to estimate lowland forest cover in 1998 and 2018. We used Bayesian belief networks with 20 variables to evaluate vulnerability of the forest that remained in 2018. Analyses were conducted at two spatial scales: landscape patch (analogous to ecoregion) and country level. Over 20 years, >120,000 km2 of forest (50% of forest present in 1998) was lost. Of the 14 lowland forest patches, 6 lost >50% of their area. At the country scale, Cambodia had the greatest deforestation (>47,500 km2). In 2018, 18% of the lowlands were forested, and 20% of these forests had some formal protection. Approximately 50% of the lowland forest inside protected areas (c. 11,000 km2) was also lost during the study period. Most lowland forest remaining is highly vulnerable; eight landscape patches had >50% categorized as such. Our results add to a growing body of evidence that the presence of protected areas alone will not prevent further deforestation.

A decade after its inception in the Digital Earth 2020 vision, GHSL is an established project of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and an integral part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The 2023 GHSL edition, a result of rigorous research on Earth Observation data and population censuses, contributes significantly to understanding worldwide human settlements. It introduces new elements like 10-m-resolution, sub-pixel estimation of built-up surfaces, global building height and volume estimates, and a classification of residential and non-residential areas, improving population density grids. This paper evaluates the key components of the GHSL, including the Symbolic Machine Learning approach, using novel reference data. These data enable a comparative assessment of GHSL model predictions on the evolution of built-up surface, building heights, and resident population. Empirical evidence suggests that GHSL estimates are the most accurate in the public domain today, e.g. achieving an IoU of 0.98 for the water class, 0.92 for the built-up class, and 0.8 for the non-residential class at 10 m resolution. At 100 m resolution, we find that the MAE of built-up surface estimates corresponds to 6% of the grid cell area, the MAE for the building height estimates is 2.27 m, and we find a total allocation accuracy of 83% for resident population.

300,lde_lesotho_eco_2025,submission form,24/09/2025,Naema_GrosDubois,Lesotho National Map of Ecosystem Types,english,"This map is composed of several layers. The first map presents ecosystems at a level that is consistent with Levels 5 or 6 of the Global Ecosystem Typology (South African National Biodiversity Institute (2006- ). The Vegetation Map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, Mucina, L., Rutherford, M.C. and Powrie, L.W. (Editors), Online, https://bgis.sanbi.org/Projects/Detail/2258, Version 2024.). The South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) has cross referenced these ecosystems to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystems Typology. The result is a map of ecosystem functional groups at Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. 

The second layer contains spatial information on anthropogenic or human-modified terrestrial ecosystems, based on Lesotho’s national landcover atlas (FAO. (2023). Lesotho: Land cover atlas 2017–2021. Maseru). This information presents ten landcover classes identified using satellite remote sensing. The ten landcover classes were cross-referenced to Level 3 of the Global Ecosystem Typology. Of note, tree- and shrub-covered landscapes identified from landcover are reassigned to the underlying ecosystem functional group (which, in the case of Lesotho, is Temperate subhumid grasslands). This is because even if these ecosystems are covered by woody vegetation, they retain the same predominant ecological drivers of grasslands (i.e. grazing, fires, frost, seasonal precipitation). Similarly, erosion gullies are considered as degraded versions of the underlying ecosystems, rather than a distinct ecosystem functional group. Bare surfaces identified from satellite tend to represent exposed sandstone within grassland ecosystems, rather than a distinct ecosystem functional group. Based on this, landcover information can be used to identify human-modified ecosystem functional groups

The third layer contains spatial information on the distribution of freshwater ecosystems. For the F2.3. Seasonal Freshwater Lakes, the national land cover data was used (FAO. (2023). Lesotho: Land cover atlas 2017–2021. Maseru.). For dams (Lehner, B., Beames, P., Mulligan, M. et al. (2024). The Global Dam Watch database of river barrier and reservoir information for large-scale applications. Sci Data 11, 1069), we distinguished between two ecosystem functional groups depending on the depth of the waterbody. Dams that were deeper than 15 m were classified as F3.1 Large Reservoirs. Dams shallower than 15m were classified as F3.2 Constructed Lacustrine Wetlands. For rivers (Resource Quality Services (was IWQS) and Chief Directorate of National GeoSpatial Information (was Surveys and Mapping) (2012) Rivers of South Africa. Department of Water Affair, Pretoria, South Africa), permanent or perennial rivers were classified as F1.1. Permanent upland streams. Non-perennial streams and streams with unknown flow status were classified as F1.2 Seasonal upland streams. Wetlands identified from landcover data were all classified as F2.3 Seasonal freshwater lakes.

(Lecythidaceae), represents one of the main income-generation activities for local and indigenous people from the Brazilian Amazon region. Because trees of B. excelsa grow and bear fruit almost exclusively in natural forests, information on their spatial distribution is crucial for nut harvest planning. However, this information is difficult to obtain with traditional approaches such as ground-based surveys. Here, we show the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and WorldView-3 satellite images (pixel size = 30 cm) to map individual tree crowns (ITCs) and groves of B. excelsa in Amazonian forests. First, we manually outlined B. excelsa ITCs in the WorldView-3 images using field-acquired geolocation information. Then, based on ITC boundaries, we sequentially extracted image patches and selected 80% of them for training and 20% for testing. We trained the DeepLabv3+ architecture with three backbones: ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2. The average producer's accuracy was 93.87 ± 0.85%, 93.89 ± 1.6% and 93.47 ± 3.6% for ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2, respectively. We then developed a new random patch extraction training strategy and assessed how a reduction in the percentage of training patches impacted the classification accuracy. To illustrate the robustness of the new training strategy, similar F1-scores were achieved whether 80% or 10% of the total number of patches were used to train the CNN model. By analyzing the feature maps derived from ResNet-18, we found that the shadow of emergent B. excelsa trees are important for their discrimination. Geometric distortions in the WorldView-3 images resulting from extreme off-nadir viewing angles compromise the presence of shadows, thus potentially hampering B. excelsa detection. Our results show that ITCs and groves of B. excelsa can be mapped by integrating CNNs and very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite images, paving the way for monitoring this important tree species in large tracts of Amazonian forests.",NA,Bioverse Tecnologia e Inovação em Monitoramento Ambiental and UNICEF Innovation Venture Fund,"Ferreira, Matheus Pinheiro, et al.

Although habitats will be inundated, ecosystems have the potential to shift inland, and endemic species may persist if conditions are favorable. Predictions of ecosystem migration due to sea level rise need to account for current stressors, which may reduce the resilience of these ecosystems. This study predicts the potential consequences of sea level rise on the groundwater-fed anchialine pool ecosystem in Hawaii. Scenarios of marine and groundwater inundation were compared with current patterns of habitat, introduced fishes, and land use. Results show that current habitats containing endemic anchialine shrimp will be increasingly inundated by marine waters. New habitats will emerge in areas that are low lying and undeveloped. Because of subsurface hydrologic connectivity, endemic shrimp are likely to populate these new habitats by moving through the coastal aquifer. In some areas, rising sea levels will provide surface connectivity between pools currently containing introduced fishes (tilapia, poeciliids) and up to 46 % of new or existing pools that do not contain these fish. Results predicting future habitat distribution and condition due to sea level rise will support conservation planning.

Addressing this concern through effective management holds immense potential for climate regulation, mitigation, and adaptation efforts. As such, there is growing need for timely spatial inventory data identifying Arctic wetlands with sufficient accuracy, resolution, and detail. Wetland mapping at large scales necessitates the processing of large volumes of Earth observation (EO) data, a challenge known as “Big Data”. Consequently, in this study, we present a cloud-based methodology exploiting the remarkable collection of EO data and computational power of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to map Arctic wetlands at 10 m spatial resolution. Our workflow evaluated temporally aggregated optical and radar satellite imagery and novel hydro-physiographic layers as inputs into a robust Random Forest (RF) machine learning (ML) algorithm. Both pixel and object-based classification approaches were assessed, whereby ML models were calibrated with a training dataset of sufficient and comprehensive samples. The study was conducted over Canada’s Southern Arctic ecozone (830,000 km2). GEE enabled the efficient preprocessing and classification of large volumes of EO data and resulted in excellent yet similar statistical performance for both pixel and object-based approaches, achieving overall accuracies of > 89 % and mean F1-scores of > 0.79. Moreover, McNemar tests indicated that these classifications were not statistically different, which has significant implications regarding computing time and processing efficiencies.

These organic-rich soils are widespread across permafrost regions, representing nearly 18% of land surface and storing between 500 and 600 petagrams of carbon (PgC). Peat (i.e., partially decomposed thick organic layers) accumulates due to the imbalance between plant production and decomposition often within saturated, nutrient deficient, and acidic soils, which limit decomposition. As warmer and drier conditions become more prevalent across northern ecosystems, the vulnerability of peatland soils may increase with the susceptibility of peat-fire ignitions, yet the distribution of peatlands across Alaska remains uncertain.

They are compulsory in all integrated landscape management and development programs.

In an effort to promote more bottom-up landscape management, CIRAD and CIFOR have developed a large-scale vegetation mapping initiative in line with the new regulation for mapping at the regency level.
Ecological mapping principles
The ecological vegetation map methodology used by CIRAD and CIFOR was developed by the Vegetation School of the Toulouse University in France. The method has been adopted by UNESCO and FAO in many countries. The principle is that it focuses on understanding the decisive ecological factor(s) that will induce the different vegetation types and their successional stages, and therefore it underlines the fact that vegetation is the finest indicator of the environment.

New 90 meter base resolution continental datasets were developed for several key physical environment datalayers including coastlines, land surface forms, surficial lithology, and bioclimates. These unique physical components, considered as the fundamental building blocks of ecosystems, were reviewed by regional vegetation and landscape ecology experts and used in a classification and regression tree (CART) inductive model to map intermediate scale Africa terrestrial ecosystems. In the final dataset a total of 126 terrestrial ecosystem types were mapped, each with multiple, repeating occurrences on the landscape.","Terrestrial ecosystems and vegetation of Africa were classified and mapped as part of a larger effort and global protocol (GEOSS – the Global Earth Observation System of Systems), which includes an activity to map terrestrial ecosystems of the earth in a standardized, robust, and practical manner, and at the finest possible spatial resolution. To model the potential distribution of ecosystems, new continental datasets for several key physical environment datalayers (including coastline, landforms, surficial lithology, and bioclimates) were developed at spatial and classification resolutions finer than existing similar datalayers. A hierarchical vegetation classification was developed by African ecosystem scientists and vegetation geographers, who also provided sample locations of the newly classified vegetation units. The vegetation types and ecosystems were then mapped across the continent using a classification and regression tree (CART) inductive model, which predicted the potential distribution of vegetation types from a suite of biophysical environmental attributes including bioclimate region, biogeographic region, surficial lithology, landform, elevation and land cover. Multi-scale ecosystems were classified and mapped in an increasingly detailed hierarchical framework using vegetation-based concepts of class, subclass, formation, division, and macrogroup levels. The finest vegetation units (macrogroups) classified and mapped in this effort are defined using diagnostic plant species and diagnostic growth forms that reflect biogeographic differences in composition and sub-continental to regional differences in mesoclimate, geology, substrates, hydrology, and disturbance regimes (FGDC, 2008). The macrogroups are regarded as meso-scale (100s to 10,000s of hectares) ecosystems. A total of 126 macrogroup types were mapped, each with multiple, repeating occurrences on the landscape.

Numerous studies investigated the advantages of integrating deep learning models with satellite data for rice mapping, but these studies are typically confined to specific regions and the quality of customized datasets varies. The absence of a global, standardized satellite dataset for rice mapping benchmarking has long resulted in both substantial redundant data processing efforts and challenges in evaluating new algorithms under a unified benchmark. To address these deficiencies, this paper introduces Plot-Rice v1.0, a global heterogeneous rice benchmark dataset based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, along with an automated framework that integrates SAR temporal features and leverages the foundation image segmentation model SAM-2 to generate plot-level rice samples. This framework effectively addresses the limitation of SAM-2, which supports zero-shot segmentation but lacks classification capabilities. Plot-Rice comprehensively accounts for the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of rice, incorporating plot-level rice labels and corresponding multi-source feature time series from 20 countries globally. In terms of feature composition, Plot-Rice integrates multi-source features, including radar backscattering coefficients, normalized backscattering coefficients, radar vegetation indices, spectral indices, and spectral combinations, constructing time series for 12 months of 2023 to facilitate temporal analysis. Finally, using this dataset, a series of benchmark experiments is conducted, encompassing performance comparisons of models such as U-Net, Res U-Net, Deeplabv3+, and HR-Net under multi-source feature time series, and comparisons of rice distribution extraction performance across diverse countries.

Each of the African regions has its unique physical and environmental limiting factors to accurate cropland mapping, which leads to high spatial discrepancies among remote sensing cropland products. Since no dataset could cope with all limitations, multiple datasets initially derived from various remote sensing sensors and classification techniques must be integrated into a more accurate cropland product than individual layers. Here, in the current study, four cropland products, produced initially from multiple sensors (e.g. Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and PROBA–V) to cover the period (2015–2017), were integrated based on their cropland mapping accuracy to build a more accurate cropland layer. The four cropland layers’ accuracy was assessed at Agro-ecological zones units via an intensive reference dataset (17,592 samples). The most accurate cropland layer was then identified for each zone to construct the final cropland mask at 30 m resolution for the nominal year of 2016 over Africa. As a result, the new layer was produced in higher cropland mapping accuracy (overall accuracy = 91.64% and cropland’s F-score = 0.75). The layer mapped the African cropland area as 282 Mha (9.38% of the Continent area). Compared to earlier cropland synergy layers, the constructed cropland mask showed a considerable improvement in its spatial resolution (30 m instead of 250 m), mapping quality, and closeness to official statistics (R2 = 0.853 and RMSE = 2.85 Mha).

However, such understanding should preferably be updated at seasonal intervals for each agricultural system rather than relying on a single annual assessment. Here we present the European Space Agency-funded WorldCereal system, a global, seasonal, and reproducible crop and irrigation mapping system that addresses existing limitations in current global-scale crop and irrigation mapping. WorldCereal generates a range of global products, including temporary crop extent, seasonal maize and cereal maps, seasonal irrigation maps, seasonal active cropland maps, and model confidence layers providing insights into expected product quality. The WorldCereal product suite for the year 2021 presented here serves as a global demonstration of the dynamic open-source WorldCereal system. Validation of the products was done based on best available reference data per product. A global statistical validation for the temporary crop extent product resulted in user's and producer's accuracies of 88.5 % and 92.1 %, respectively. For crop type, a verification was performed against a newly collected street view dataset (overall agreement 82.5 %) and a limited number of publicly available in situ datasets (reaching minimum agreement of 80 %). Finally, global irrigated-area estimates were derived from available maps and statistical datasets, revealing the conservative nature of the WorldCereal irrigation product. The WorldCereal system provides a vital tool for policymakers, international organizations, and researchers to better understand global crop and irrigation patterns and to inform decision-making related to food security and sustainable agriculture. Our findings highlight the need for continued community efforts such as additional reference data collection to support further development and to push the boundaries for global agricultural mapping from space.

Here, we produced the first 20 m global coconut palm layer using a U-Net model that was trained on annual Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 composites for the year 2020. The overall accuracy was 99.04 ± 0.21 %, which was significantly higher than the no-information rate. The producer's accuracy for coconut palm was 71.51 ± 23.11 % when only closed-canopy coconut palm was considered in the validation, but this decreased to 11.30 ± 2.33 % when sparse and dense open-canopy coconut palm was also taken into account.

We created detailed maps of 295 mines producing copper, gold, silver, platinum group elements, molybdenum, lead-zinc, nickel, uranium or diamonds, representing the dominant share of global production of these commodities. The mapping entailed the delineation and classification of 3,736 open pits, waste rock dumps, water ponds, tailings storage facilities, heap leach pads, milling infrastructure and other features, totalling ~3,633 km2. Collectively, our maps highlight that mine areas can be highly heterogeneous in composition and diverse in form, reflecting variations in underlying geology, commodities produced, topography and mining methods. Our study therefore emphasises that distinguishing between specific mine features in satellite imagery may foster more refined assessments of mine-related impacts. We also compiled detailed annual data on the operational characteristics of 129 mines to show via regression analysis that the sum area of a mine's features is mainly explained by its cumulative production volume (cross-validated R2 of 0.73).

This is also the case in Madeira archipelago (Eastern Atlantic), where until recently our knowledge on rhodolith beds was limited to a few references to its occurrence and species composition. In the course of an ongoing habitat-mapping project developed in Madeira, observations revealed that rhodolith beds are more common and extensive than previously supposed.","The habitat maps for these beds in Madeira archipelago here presented are the first ever produced for the region. They reveal a total of 46 rhodolith beds at eleven different locations spread across three islands (Madeira, Desertas and Porto Santo), with areas ranging from 776 to 101,081 m2 and at depths between 12 and 35 m. Author’s observations, as well as the results suggest that more rhodolith beds are likely to exist in the archipelago, particularly at greater depths and unexplored locations. The application of molecular systematic tools for the identification of rhodolith-forming species revealed the occurrence of four species belonging to the genera Lithothamnion and Phymatolithon. This latter genus is represented by a single species which is commonly found in rhodolith beds of the archipelago.

The accuracy of the dataset achieves an overall accuracy of 86.30%, with both user’s and producer’s accuracies exceeding 85%. The reliability of the dataset is verified by an R2 values ranging between 0.93 and 0.98 with respect to different official statistics.","In recent years, the demand for rice in Africa has been growing rapidly, and, in order to meet this demand, the rice cultivation area is also expanding rapidly; thus, it is of great significance to monitor the rice cultivation in Africa. The spatial and temporal distribution of rice cultivation in Africa is complex, making it difficult to use phenology-based rice identification methods, and the existing rice distribution products of Africa are all made up of grid-based statistical data with a low resolution, unable to obtain accurate rice field location and available labels. To address these two difficulties, based on time series optical and dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, this study proposes a sample set construction method by means of fast-coarse-positioning-assisted visual interpretation and a feature-importance-guided supervised classification combining multiple temporal optical and SAR features to reduce the impact of rice diversity in Africa. Firstly, we use the time series statistical features of vertical transmit, horizontal receive (VH) data for fast coarse positioning and screening of possible rice areas and combine multiple auxiliary data for visual interpretation to construct the sample set; secondly, based on the complementary information in SAR data and optical data, the 20 m Africa rice distribution map of 2023 was completed by combining the object-oriented segmentation results of temporal optical images and the pixel-based classification results of temporal SAR data features after feature selection. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method for the validation set is more than 85 %, and the R2 of the linear fit to various existing statistical data is more than 0.9, which proves that the proposed method can achieve the spatial distribution mapping of rice under complex climatic conditions in a large region, providing crucial data support for rice monitoring and agricultural policy development.

For those reasons, we developed a 30m spatial resolution  map of the terrestrial ecosystems of the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) and adjacent areas in Mexico and Canada based on the latest version of the U.S. National Vegetation Classification  (USNVC), which provides a comprehensive, hierarchical, standard, authoritative ecosystem  classification well suited for use in ecosystem mapping. The map builds on a previous map of ecosystems that was developed in a collaboration between NatureServe, a conservation NGO, and LANDFIRE, an interagency wildland fire management spatial data program that is supported and managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management and the U.S. Department of the Interior Office of Wildland Fire. The map  documents the USNVC group types, which are mid-level ecosystems of the 8-level USNVC hierarchy; 323 groups and eight additional land cover and anthropogenic land use categories are mapped across the entire map extent, with 308 groups present in CONUS. The USNVC v3.0 and NatureServe’s International Vegetation Classification (IVC) were recently aligned with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Ecosystem Typology (GET) in support of global ecosystem assessments. The GET is the reference classification for the Group  on Earth Observation’s (GEO) Global Ecosystem Atlas (GEA) initiative; thus, we can aggregate the USNVC map units to the GET ecosystem types for use by GEA for the U.S. portion of the Atlas. The USNVC is suitable for this product because it is the national standard for vegetation classification adopted by the Federal Geographic Data Committee, is maintained through peer review by the Ecological Society of America’s Vegetation Classification Panel, and provides a standard for the 50 states and other programs in the NatureServe Network.
